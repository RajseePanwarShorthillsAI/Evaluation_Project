Family
Almost all of us live in a family. The family is the fundamental 
and most ancient unit of any society. In Indian society today, 
there are several types of families — from joint families 
to nuclear families. A joint family has several generations 
living together — grandparents, parents, uncles and aunts,

of this village — maybe water for the fields, repairing the

addition to the Earth, they show respect to the spirits of the river,
the forest and the mountain. Since each village knows where its
boundaries lie, the local people look after all the natural resources
within that boundary.  If people from a village want to take some
wood from the forests of another village, they pay a small fee called
devsari, dand or man in exchange. Some villages also protect their forests
by engaging watchmen and each household contributes some grain
to pay them.  Every year there is one big hunt where the headmen of
villages in a pargana (cluster of  villa ges) meet and discuss issues of
concern, including forests.

Kamal Parmar , owner of a small auto-fabrication workshop, 
noticed a group of underprivileged children on the street. 
Some had dropped out of school, while others had never

provided the kids with a free dinner . Soon, 150 children 
were attending those classes regularly and were deeply 
interested in the lessons! 
A few teachers from a local school noticed the classes and

Introduction 
Earlier chapters have shown us how, 
in a democracy, good governance  
aims to empower the citizens so they 
may actively participate in their 
country’s functioning, whether it is 
at the rural, regional, urban, state 
or national level. This is the broader 
concept of participatory democracy. 
We saw the basics of the system in 
a rural context. Let us now see how  
it works in an urban scenario. Since 
the latter is generally more complex 
and diverse than the former , it is understandable that the 
urban governance system needs to be more complex too. 
We will however limit ourselves here to its basic principles.

Questions
Family
Almost all of us live in a family. The family is the fundamental 
and most ancient unit of any society. In Indian society today, 
there are several types of families — from joint families 
to nuclear families. A joint family has several generations 
living together — grandparents, parents, uncles and aunts, 
Love and dharma are the flower and fruit of family life.

a group of connected people may be called a ‘community’ 
(there are other meanings for ‘community’, depending on 
the context). Members of a community come together for 
various reasons, like celebrating festivals and organising 
feasts, weddings and other events. In some villages, people 
come together to support each other with agricultural 
practices like land preparation, sowing and harvesting. 
Over time, communities often agreed upon some practices 
on the use of shared natural wealth and resources such  
as water , grazing lands and forest produce. This is the case 
with many tribal communities.  To some extent, this remains 
the case in village communities in rural India today. Such 
practices — we may call them ‘rules’, though they were 
rarely written down — have provided communities a secure 
access to resources. But it also means that all families and"
Why do many people feel a sense of belonging in their community?,"According to the context, many people feel a sense of belonging in their community because it is often defined by shared interests, work, or religion. For instance, a jāti (a subdivision) or a Residents' Welfare Association can be considered as a community where people participate in making rules and regulations together. This interdependence among communities creates a sense of belonging among individuals who are part of these communities.","The provided text describes what constitutes a community and gives examples like jati, religious groups, regional groups, common interest groups, and residents’ welfare associations.  It explains how communities function through interdependence, such as residents’ associations relying on traders and municipal workers.","Make a list of all people outside your family that are supporting

These shared efforts lead to a stronger sense of community and benefit society as a whole.","Volunteering strengthens a community by enabling people to contribute to society without expecting anything in return, fostering collective efforts like the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan for cleanliness, and promoting awareness and conservation through initiatives such as Van Mahotsav.

members are elected directly by the Gram Sabha, which is 
a group of adults from a village (or group of neighbouring 
villages) who are enrolled as voters. In the Gram Sabha, 
women and men discuss all matters related to their area 
and take decisions. Each Gram Panchayat elects a head

There are many definitions for this social entity. Today, 
anthropologists usually consider a tribe to be a group of 
families or clans sharing a tradition of common descent, a 
culture and a language, living as a close-knit community 
under a chief and holding no private property.
Interestingly, ancient India did not have a word for ‘tribe’ 
— tribes were just different janas that lived in a specific 
environment, such as forests or mountains. The Constitution 
of India uses the terms ‘tribes’ and ‘tribal communities’ in 
English, and janjāti in Hindi.
According to official figures, in 2011 India had 705 tribes 
spread over most States, amounting to a population of about 
104 million people — more than the populations of Australia 
and the United Kingdom together!
In the 19 th century, anthropologists studying tribes often 
described them as ‘primitive’ or ‘inferior’ to civilised people.

Why is local government important in rural areas?,"Based on the context, local government is important in rural areas because it provides a mechanism for citizens to come together and take decisions about what is best for them. In rural areas like Lakshmanpur, where most people are farmers, local government helps manage issues such as crop cultivation and other community concerns.","Local government is important in rural areas because India is a country of enormous size and diversity with a large rural population.  Governing such a complex society requires localized administration.  The example of Lakshmanpur village illustrates the need for local governance to address the specific needs of rural communities.

Local Government in  
Rural Areas
CHAPTER11 
The real India lives in its villages.
– M.K. Gandhi
Let us now see how the government functions at the local 
level. In this chapter , our focus will be on local government in 
rural areas; we will move to urban areas in the next chapter . 
India is a country of enormous size and diversity. We have 
about 600,000 villages, 8,000 towns and over 4,000 cities. 
Our population has crossed 1.4 billion, almost two-thirds of 
which live in rural areas. How do we govern ourselves in this 
complex society? 
Let us take a trip to Lakshmanpur , a small village in the 
foothills of the Himalayas. It has 200 houses and a population 
of about 700, most of whom are farmers. People cultivate

Governance and Democracy
Introduction 
Earlier chapters have shown us how, 
in a democracy, good governance  
aims to empower the citizens so they 
may actively participate in their 
country’s functioning, whether it is 
at the rural, regional, urban, state 
or national level. This is the broader 
concept of participatory democracy. 
We saw the basics of the system in 
a rural context. Let us now see how  
it works in an urban scenario. Since 
the latter is generally more complex 
and diverse than the former , it is understandable that the 
urban governance system needs to be more complex too. 
We will however limit ourselves here to its basic principles.
LET’S EXPLORE

and diverse than a village or a town?

top, the local communities have a direct say on how their 
areas are managed or the issues they face. It is a mechanism 
for citizens living in an area to come together and take 
decisions about what is best for them. 
Cities and towns are divided into smaller units called 
‘wards’, and the ward committees facilitate activities 
such as conducting health camps, organising a campaign 
against the use of single-use plastics, and so on. They also 
keep an eye on anything that might go wrong — a water 
leak, a blocked drain, a damaged road, etc. — and report 
such problems to the authorities. However , the precise 
functioning of wards differs from State to State, depending 
on the rules they make.
Altogether , urban local bodies are responsible for a range 
of functions — helping take care of the infrastructure, 
maintaining the burial ground, garbage collection and 
disposal, checking the implementation of government"
What are the three levels of the Panchayati Raj system?,"Based on the provided context, the three levels of the Panchayati Raj system are:

1. Village level: Gram Panchayat / Village Parishad
2. Block level: Block Panchayat / Panchayat Samiti / Mandal Parishad
3. District level: District Panchayat / Zila Parishad","Village level (Gram Panchayat/Village Parishad), Block level (Block Panchayat/Panchayat Samiti/Mandal Parishad), and District level (District Panchayat/Zila Parishad).
","Panchayati Raj System
Like every village in India, the Lakshmanpur people have 
a system of local government called ‘Panchayat’, which 
refers to a village council. Panchayats bring governance 
closer to the people, making it possible for them to actively 
participate in decision-making processes. That is why 
the Panchayat system, also known as Panchayati Raj, is 
a form of self-government. Panchayats play a vital role 
in addressing local issues, promoting development and 
ensuring that the benefits of government schemes reach 
the grassroots level.

11 ― Grassroots Democracy – Part 2
As is clear from the diagram, the Panchayati Raj system 
works at three levels — from bottom up — the village, the 
block and the district. This is called a ‘three-tier system’. 
Together , these institutions’ responsibilities cover almost 
all aspects of life in the district, from agriculture, housing, 
maintenance of roads, management of water resources, 
education, health care and social welfare to cultural 
activities.
Gram Panchayat
Let us begin with the base of Fig. 11.1 on page 164 — the Gram 
Panchayat, which is closest to the people in rural areas. Its 
members are elected directly by the Gram Sabha, which is 
a group of adults from a village (or group of neighbouring 
villages) who are enrolled as voters. In the Gram Sabha, 
women and men discuss all matters related to their area 
and take decisions. Each Gram Panchayat elects a head 
or president called the ‘Sarpanch’ or ‘Pradhan’. In recent","171

“The king shall establish a sangrahaṇa (a sub-district head  
quarters) for every 10 villages; a kārvaṭika (district headquarters) 
for every 100 villages; a droṇamukha for every 400 villages; and 
a sthānīya (provincial headquarters) for every 800 villages.” 
In today’s language, what are the names we would give these 
four categories? Is it not amazing that a similar structure was 
thought of so long ago?
Before we move on ...
 → The local government in rural areas is organised into a 
three-tier system.
 → Democracy in the Panchayati Raj system works both  
through direct participation of people and through their 
elected representatives.
 → The Panchayati Raj institutions give people in rural areas 
a measure of self-governance, so they may manage their 
issues and collaborate in development plans.

* It is responsible for covering almost all aspects of life in the district, including agriculture, housing, maintenance of roads, management of water resources, education, health care, and social welfare.
* The head or president of the Gram Panchayat is called the ""Sarpanch"" or ""Pradhan"", which is elected by the Gram Panchayat itself.","The Gram Panchayat's members are elected by the Gram Sabha (a group of adult village voters).

The term grassroots democracy refers to a system that 
enables and encourages the participation of ordinary 
citizens — the base of the pyramid we saw in Fig. 10.4 on 
page 155. In such a system, the citizens can have a say in 
decisions which affect them.

next two chapters and also in later grades.

 Æ No country can run without governance and government.
 Æ A modern government has three organs — legislative, 
executive and judiciary — which need to work together .
 Æ The Indian government functions at three levels — Centre 
or national, State and local.
 Æ Democracy is the overall framework for this system. It 
functions through elected representatives, both at the State 
and the national levels.

10 ― Grassroots Democracy – Part 1
Democracy
You may have noticed that we earlier mentioned 
‘representatives of the people’. This is one of the foundation 
stones of the system of governance adopted by most countries 
of the world — democracy. The word ‘democracy’ comes 
from two Greek words — dēmos meaning ‘people’, and 
kratos meaning ‘rule’ or ‘power’; so ‘democracy’ literally 
means the ‘rule of the people’. 
But can all people actually rule? It is clearly not possible. 
Imagine there is a problem that your class wants to bring 
to the attention of your school’s principal — maybe there is 
something wrong with the classroom, or with the school’s 
infrastructure, or perhaps you would like to propose a 
certain date for a field trip. Will the entire class go to the 
principal? It would clearly not be practical. In many schools, 
classes have a ‘class monitor’ or ‘class representative’, 
whom the whole class elected; even if there is none, one"
What is the role of women in Panchayati Raj?,"According to the given context, the role of women in Panchayati Raj is that they discuss all matters related to their area and take decisions along with men.

closer to the people, making it possible for them to actively 
participate in decision-making processes. That is why

Law against child marriage  
With the growth of women’s organisations 
and writings on these issues, the 
momentum for reform gained strength. 
People challenged another established 
custom –  that of child marriage. There 
were a number of Indian legislators in the 
Central Legislative Assembly who fought 
to make a law preventing child marriage. 
In 1929, the Child Marriage Restraint Act 
was passed without the kind of bitter 
debates and struggles that earlier laws 
had seen. According to the Act, no man 
below the age of 18 and woman below 
the age of 16 could marry. Subsequently 
these limits were raised to 21 for men and 
18 for women.

Introduction 
Earlier chapters have shown us how, 
in a democracy, good governance  
aims to empower the citizens so they 
may actively participate in their 
country’s functioning, whether it is 
at the rural, regional, urban, state 
or national level. This is the broader 
concept of participatory democracy. 
We saw the basics of the system in 
a rural context. Let us now see how  
it works in an urban scenario. Since 
the latter is generally more complex 
and diverse than the former , it is understandable that the 
urban governance system needs to be more complex too.

What is proto-industrialisation?,"Proto-industrialisation refers to a phase of industrial production before the Industrial Revolution, characterized by large-scale industrial production for an international market, not based on factories. Instead, it involved merchants supplying money to family farms and workers, controlling hundreds of producers working within their family farms.","According to the provided text, proto-industrialisation refers to the phase of industrialisation that existed *before* factories became common in England and Europe. It involved large-scale industrial production for an international market, but it was not based on factories. Merchants from towns would supply money to peasants in the countryside, who would then produce goods within their family farms. This system was controlled by merchants and involved a network of commercial exchanges.

1  Before the Industrial Revolution
All too often we associate industrialisation with the growth of
factory industry. When we talk of  industrial pr
oduction we refer
to factory production. When we talk of industrial workers we
mean factory workers. Histories of industrialisation very often begin
with the setting up of the first factories.
There is a problem with such ideas. Even before factories began to
dot the landscape in England and Europe, there was large-scale
industrial production for an international market. This was not based
on f actories . Many historians no w r efer to this phase of
industrialisation as proto-industrialisation.
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, merchants from the towns
in Europe began moving to the countryside, supplying money to","time of technological progress.
These images and associations have now become part of popular
imagination. Do you not see rapid industrialisation as a time of
progress and modernity? Do you not think that the spread of railways
and factories, and construction of high-rise buildings and bridges is
a sign of society’s development?
How have these images developed? And how do we relate to these
ideas? Is industrialisation always based on rapid technological
development? Can we today continue to glorify continuous
mechanisation of all work? What has industrialisation meant to
people’s lives? To answer such questions we need to turn to the
history of industrialisation.
In this chapter we will look at this history by focusing first on Britain,
the first industrial nation, and then India, where the pattern of
industrial change was conditioned by colonial rule.

Printers, 26 January 1901.

This proto-industrial system was thus part of a network of
commercial exchanges. It was controlled by merchants and the goods
were produced by a vast number of producers working within
their family farms, not in factories. At each stage of production 20
to 25 workers were employed by each merchant. This meant that
each clothier was controlling hundreds of workers.
1.1 The Coming Up of the Factory
The earliest factories in Eng land came up b y the 1730s . But it
was only in the late eighteenth century that the number of
factories multiplied.
The first symbol of the new era was cotton. Its production boomed
in the late nineteenth century. In 1760 Britain was importing 2.5
million pounds of raw cotton to feed its cotton industry. By 1787
this import soared to 22 million pounds. 
This increase was linked to
a number of changes within the process of production. Let us look
briefly at some of these.

Why are urban local bodies important?,"According to the context, urban local bodies are important because they:

* Allow local communities to have a direct say in how their areas are managed and issues they face are addressed
* Facilitate decision-making among citizens living in an area
* Conduct activities such as health camps, campaigns against single-use plastics, and monitoring infrastructure (roads, drains, etc.)
* Report problems to authorities

In summary, urban local bodies are important for grassroots democracy and governance, enabling citizens to participate in decision-making processes that affect their daily lives.","Urban local bodies are important because they allow local communities to have a direct say in how their areas are managed.

closer to the people, making it possible for them to actively 
participate in decision-making processes. That is why

a form of self-government. Panchayats play a vital role 
in addressing local issues, promoting development and

Indore in Madhya Pradesh has been awarded the cleanest 
city in India under the Swachh Survekshan government 
scheme for seven years in a row. What could have been the 
role of Indore citizens in this achievement?
As we see, Chennai and Indore have a Municipal Corpo-
ration at the top of their urban bodies. Only cities with a 
population above 10 lakhs have a Municipal Corporation 
(also called ‘Mahanagar Nigam’) as their highest body. 
Between 1 and 10 lakhs, the highest body is a Municipal 
Council (also called ‘Nagar Palika’). Cities and towns with 
smaller populations have a Nagar Panchayat.

Governance and Democracy
Introduction 
Earlier chapters have shown us how, 
in a democracy, good governance  
aims to empower the citizens so they 
may actively participate in their 
country’s functioning, whether it is 
at the rural, regional, urban, state 
or national level. This is the broader 
concept of participatory democracy. 
We saw the basics of the system in 
a rural context. Let us now see how  
it works in an urban scenario. Since 
the latter is generally more complex 
and diverse than the former , it is understandable that the 
urban governance system needs to be more complex too. 
We will however limit ourselves here to its basic principles.

a sthānīya (provincial headquarters) for every 800 villages.” 
In today’s language, what are the names we would give these

three-tier system.
 → Democracy in the Panchayati Raj system works both  
through direct participation of people and through their 
elected representatives.

a measure of self-governance, so they may manage their 
issues and collaborate in development plans.

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, merchants from the towns
in Europe began moving to the countryside, supplying money to
peasants and artisans, persuading them to produce for an international
market. With the expansion of world trade and the acquisition of
colonies in different parts of the world, the demand for goods
began growing. But merchants could not expand production within
towns. This was because here urban crafts and trade guilds were
powerful. These were associations of producers that trained
craftspeople, maintained control over production, regulated
competition and prices, and restricted the entry of new people into
the trade. Rulers granted different guilds the monopoly
right to produce and trade in specific products. It was
therefore difficult for new merchants to set up
business in towns. So they turned to the countryside.
In the countryside poor peasants and artisans began","This had to be done in a way that could yield enough revenue to

Over the years, the Company also learnt that it had to 
move with some caution. Being an alien power, it needed 
to pacify those who in the past had ruled the countryside, 
and enjoyed authority and prestige. Those who had held 
local power had to be controlled but they could not be  
entirely eliminated.
How was this to be done? In this chapter we will see how the 
Company came to colonise the countryside, organise revenue 
resources, redefine the rights of people, and produce the crops 
it wanted.

The Company had become the Diwan, but it still saw itself 
primarily as a trader. It wanted a large revenue income but 
was unwilling to set up any regular system of assessment and

could and buy fine cotton and silk cloth as cheaply as possible.

What were trade guilds?,"According to the context, trade guilds were associations of producers that:

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, merchants from the towns
in Europe began moving to the countryside, supplying money to
peasants and artisans, persuading them to produce for an international

colonies in different parts of the world, the demand for goods
began growing. But merchants could not expand production within
towns. This was because here urban crafts and trade guilds were
powerful. These were associations of producers that trained
craftspeople, maintained control over production, regulated

Why are elections important for urban governance?,"According to the provided context, elections are important for urban governance because they enable citizens' active participation in their city's functioning, as seen in the quote: ""everyone's voice matters."" This is a fundamental principle of participatory democracy, which aims to empower citizens and ensure that their voices are heard.","The provided context does not explicitly state why elections are important for urban governance. However, it implies that urban local bodies are important in governance and democracy, and that citizens' voices matter. Elections are the method through which the community can choose its local representatives.

From my own knowledge, elections are important for urban governance because they allow citizens to choose their representatives, ensuring accountability and responsiveness from those in power. This participatory approach is crucial for addressing the complex and diverse needs of urban populations.

The  Age  of  Industrialisation
Fig. 22 – The first office of the Madras Chamber of Commerce.
By the late nineteenth century merchants in different regions began
meeting and forming Chambers of Commerce to regulate business and
decide on issues of collective concern.
5  The Peculiarities of Industrial Growth
European Managing Agencies, which dominated industrial
production in India, were interested in certain kinds of products.
They established tea and coffee plantations, acquiring land at cheap
rates from the colonial government; and they invested in mining,
indigo and jute. Most of these were products required primarily for
export trade and not for sale in India.
When Indian businessmen began setting up industries in the late
nineteenth century
, they avoided competing with Manchester goods
in the Indian market. Since yarn was not an important part of British
imports into India, the early cotton mills in India produced coarse"

","finishing centre.
This proto-industrial system was thus part of a network of
commercial exchanges. It was controlled by merchants and the goods
were produced by a vast number of producers working within
their family farms, not in factories. At each stage of production 20
to 25 workers were employed by each merchant. This meant that
each clothier was controlling hundreds of workers.
1.1 The Coming Up of the Factory
The earliest factories in Eng land came up b y the 1730s . But it
was only in the late eighteenth century that the number of
factories multiplied.
The first symbol of the new era was cotton. Its production boomed
in the late nineteenth century. In 1760 Britain was importing 2.5
million pounds of raw cotton to feed its cotton industry. By 1787
this import soared to 22 million pounds. 
This increase was linked to
a number of changes within the process of production. Let us look
briefly at some of these.
A series of inventions in the eighteenth century increased the efficacy","81
The  Age  of  Industrialisation

You can see each member of the family involved in the

1  Before the Industrial Revolution
All too often we associate industrialisation with the growth of
factory industry. When we talk of  industrial pr
oduction we refer
to factory production. When we talk of industrial workers we
mean factory workers. Histories of industrialisation very often begin
with the setting up of the first factories.
There is a problem with such ideas. Even before factories began to
dot the landscape in England and Europe, there was large-scale
industrial production for an international market. This was not based
on f actories . Many historians no w r efer to this phase of
industrialisation as proto-industrialisation.
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, merchants from the towns
in Europe began moving to the countryside, supplying money to","dramatically across the industrial landscape. New technology was
expensive and merchants and industrialists were cautious about using
it. The machines often broke down and repair was costly. They
were not as effective as their inventors and manufacturers claimed.
Consider the case of the steam engine. James Watt improved the
steam engine produced by Newcomen and patented the new engine
in 1781. His industrialist friend Mathew Boulton manufactured the
new model. But for years he could find no buyers. At the beginning
of the nineteenth century, there were no more than 321 steam engines
all over England. Of these, 80 were
in cotton industries, nine in wool
industries, and the rest in mining,
canal works and iron works. Steam
engines were not used in any of the
other industries till much later in
the centur y. So e ven the most
powerful new tec hnolo gy tha t

invasions may have destroyed the cities, but there is no 
trace of warfare or invasion. Indeed, the Harappans do not 
seem to have kept any army or weapons of war; as far as the 
evidence goes, it seems to have been a relatively peaceful 
civilization.
Two factors are currently agreed upon. First, a climatic 
change which affected much of the world from 2200 BCE 
onward, causing reduced rainfall and a drier phase. This 
would have made agriculture more difficult and could have 
reduced food supply to the cities. Second, the Sarasvatī 
River dried up in its central basin; suddenly, cities there, 
such as Kalibangan or Banawali were abandoned. There 
could have been other factors, but these two remind us of 
how much we depend on climate and the environment for 
our well-being.

Earlier chapters have shown us how, 
in a democracy, good governance  
aims to empower the citizens so they 
may actively participate in their 
country’s functioning, whether it is 
at the rural, regional, urban, state 
or national level. This is the broader 
concept of participatory democracy. 
We saw the basics of the system in 
a rural context. Let us now see how  
it works in an urban scenario. Since 
the latter is generally more complex 
and diverse than the former , it is understandable that the 
urban governance system needs to be more complex too.

bathing in their homes; these were connected to a larger 
network of drains (Fig. 6.7), which generally ran below the 
streets and took the waste water away.

A series of inventions in the eighteenth century increased the efficacy
of each step of the production process ( carding, twisting and
spinning, and rolling). They enhanced the output per worker, enabling
each worker to produce more, and they made possible the
production of stronger threads and yarn. Then Richard Arkwright
created the cotton mill. Till this time, as you have seen, cloth
production was spread all over the countryside and carried out within
village households. But now, the costly new machines could be
purchased, set up and maintained in the mill. Within the mill all the

This proto-industrial system was thus part of a network of
commercial exchanges. It was controlled by merchants and the goods
were produced by a vast number of producers working within
their family farms, not in factories. At each stage of production 20
to 25 workers were employed by each merchant. This meant that
each clothier was controlling hundreds of workers.
1.1 The Coming Up of the Factory
The earliest factories in Eng land came up b y the 1730s . But it
was only in the late eighteenth century that the number of
factories multiplied.
The first symbol of the new era was cotton. Its production boomed
in the late nineteenth century. In 1760 Britain was importing 2.5
million pounds of raw cotton to feed its cotton industry. By 1787
this import soared to 22 million pounds. 
This increase was linked to
a number of changes within the process of production. Let us look
briefly at some of these.

The first cotton mill in Bombay came up in 1854 and it went into
production two years later. By 1862 four mills were at work with
94,000 spindles and 2,150 looms. Around the same time jute mills
came up in Bengal, the first being set up in 1855 and another one
seven years later, in 1862. In north India, the Elgin Mill was started
in Kanpur in the 1860s, and a year later the first cotton mill of
Ahmedabad was set up. By 1874, the first spinning and weaving
mill of Madras began production.

areas are managed or the issues they face. It is a mechanism 
for citizens living in an area to come together and take 
decisions about what is best for them. 
Cities and towns are divided into smaller units called 
‘wards’, and the ward committees facilitate activities 
such as conducting health camps, organising a campaign 
against the use of single-use plastics, and so on. They also 
keep an eye on anything that might go wrong — a water 
leak, a blocked drain, a damaged road, etc. — and report 
such problems to the authorities. However , the precise 
functioning of wards differs from State to State, depending 
on the rules they make.

of functions — helping take care of the infrastructure, 
maintaining the burial ground, garbage collection and

What lessons can rural areas learn from urban governance?,"The context does not directly address what lessons rural areas can learn from urban governance. However, it provides an overview of governance and democracy in India, highlighting the importance of local government systems like Panchayati Raj in rural areas. If we were to infer, some potential lessons rural areas could learn from urban governance include:

* Complexity: Urban governance may require more complex and diverse approaches than rural governance.
* Resource mobilization: Urban areas may have access to more resources and networks that could be leveraged to support rural development.

Please note that these inferences are not explicitly stated in the provided context.","The provided context does not explicitly detail specific lessons rural areas can learn from urban governance.

Over the decades, the number of economic activities has 
increased tremendously. For example, earlier most people 
were involved in activities such as agriculture, livestock

As societies progressed, the number of economic activities 
through which people earn their livelihoods increased 
vastly.
Today, there are diverse economic activities such as 
manufacturing computers, mobile phones and drones; 
working in banks, schools and hotels; driving various types

This proto-industrial system was thus part of a network of
commercial exchanges. It was controlled by merchants and the goods
were produced by a vast number of producers working within
their family farms, not in factories. At each stage of production 20
to 25 workers were employed by each merchant. This meant that
each clothier was controlling hundreds of workers.
1.1 The Coming Up of the Factory
The earliest factories in Eng land came up b y the 1730s . But it
was only in the late eighteenth century that the number of
factories multiplied.
The first symbol of the new era was cotton. Its production boomed
in the late nineteenth century. In 1760 Britain was importing 2.5
million pounds of raw cotton to feed its cotton industry. By 1787
this import soared to 22 million pounds. 
This increase was linked to
a number of changes within the process of production. Let us look
briefly at some of these.

How rapid was the process of industrialisation? Does industrialisation
mean only the growth of factory industries?
First: The most dynamic industries in Britain were clearly cotton and
metals. Growing at a rapid pace, cotton was the leading sector in the
first phase of industrialisation up to the 1840s. After that the iron
and steel industry led the way.
 With the expansion of railways, in
England from the 1840s and in the colonies from the 1860s, the
demand for iron and steel increased rapidly. By 1873 Britain was
exporting iron and steel worth about £ 77 million, double the value
of its cotton export.

difference in the way the two images show","industrialisation as proto-industrialisation.
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, merchants from the towns
in Europe began moving to the countryside, supplying money to
peasants and artisans, persuading them to produce for an international
market. With the expansion of world trade and the acquisition of
colonies in different parts of the world, the demand for goods
began growing. But merchants could not expand production within
towns. This was because here urban crafts and trade guilds were
powerful. These were associations of producers that trained
craftspeople, maintained control over production, regulated
competition and prices, and restricted the entry of new people into
the trade. Rulers granted different guilds the monopoly
right to produce and trade in specific products. It was
therefore difficult for new merchants to set up
business in towns. So they turned to the countryside.

2.3 Late nineteenth-century Colonialism
Trade flourished and markets expanded in the late nineteenth
century. But this was not only a period of expanding trade and
increased prosperity. It is important to realise that there was a
darker side to this process.  In many parts of the world, the
expansion of trade and a closer relationship with the world
economy also meant a loss of freedoms and livelihoods. Late-
nineteenth-century European conquests produced many painful
economic, social and ecological changes through which the
colonised societies were brought into the world economy.

products’ – that is, agricultural products such as wheat and cotton,
and minerals such as coal.
2.2 Role of Technology
What was the role of technology in all this? The railways, steamships,
the telegraph, for example, were important inventions without
which we cannot imagine the transformed nineteenth-century world.
But technological advances were often the result of larger social,
political and economic factors. For example, colonisation stimulated
new investments and improvements in transport: faster railways,
lighter wagons and larger ships helped move food more cheaply
and quickly from faraway farms to f

9 ― Family and Community
  What should society do to make sure that all children 
get access to education? 
New types of communities have also emerged in the last 30 
or 40 years. Residents’ Welfare Associations in many urban 
areas are examples of communities that make their own 
rules and regulations. Those could be rules about waste 
management, cleanliness of common areas, taking care of 
pets, and so on. People living in the community participate 
in making such rules and regulations. 
Communities are ultimately interdependent. The same 
Residents’ Welfare Associations, for instance, will depend 
on the trading community for supplies and also on municipal 
workers to handle waste. In our complex societies, everyone 
depends on a number of other people and communities.
LET’S EXPLORE
Make a list of all people outside your family that are supporting 
you through their work in one way or another . 
We now understand that ‘community’ is a flexible concept. 
A few more examples:","to serve Mother Earth. In 2019, Shri Mahesh Sharma of 
the Shivganga movement was honoured with the Padma 
Shri award for his transformational work with the Bhil 
communities. 
  During the Chennai floods of 2015, roads turned to rivers 
and people could no longer move around. Almost all 
shops were closed and services interrupted. Many private 
groups, in particular spiritual and religious organisations, 
cooked large quantities of food and distributed it to people 
who needed it. 
  There are many more such examples of people coming 
together to do something for the benefit of the community 
without expecting anything in return. Have you heard  
of any?
The real-life stories above illustrate community in a rural 
context. Community is also present in an urban context, 
although it may function a little differently. Let us see an 
example from another real-life story.

c. Vedic schools of thought
Vedic culture also developed many rituals (yajña, often 
read as ‘yagya’) directed towards various deities (gods or 
goddesses) for individual or collective benefit and wellbeing.
Daily rituals were generally in the form of prayers and 
offerings to Agni, the deity associated with fire, but those 
rituals became more and more complex in the course of 
time.
A group of texts known as ‘Upaniṣhads’ built upon Vedic 
concepts and introduced new ones, such as rebirth (taking 
birth again and again) and karma (our actions or their 
results). According to one school of thought, generally 
known as ‘Vedanta’, everything — human life, nature and 
the universe — is one divine essence called brahman (not 
to be confused with the god Brahmā) or sometimes just tat 
(‘that’). Two well-known mantras express this in a simple 
but profound way:

  Finally, ṛ is the Devanagari letter ऋ . We choose to write it as 
ṛi, although in some parts of India it is also pronounced as ṛu. 
So we write ‘Ṛig Veda’, for instance.

to many deities (gods or goddesses), such as Indra, Agni, 
Varuṇa, Mitra, Sarasvatī, Uṣhas, and many more. Together 
with the seers, these deities sustained ṛitam, or truth and 
order in human life and in the ‘cosmos’.
The early rishis and rishikas saw those gods and goddesses 
as one, not separate beings. As one famous hymn puts it, 
ekam sat viprā bahudhā vadanti ...
 The Existent [that is, the supreme reality] is one, 
but sages give it many names.
In this worldview, some values were especially important, 
beginning with ‘Truth’, which was often another name for 
God. The last mantras (verses) of the Ṛig Veda  also call for 
unity among people:

2.2 Role of Technology
What was the role of technology in all this? The railways, steamships,
the telegraph, for example, were important inventions without
which we cannot imagine the transformed nineteenth-century world.
But technological advances were often the result of larger social,
political and economic factors. For example, colonisation stimulated
new investments and improvements in transport: faster railways,
lighter wagons and larger ships helped move food more cheaply
and quickly from faraway farms to f
inal markets.

industrial production for an international market. This was not based
on f actories . Many historians no w r efer to this phase of

income or wealth but are done out of feelings like gratitude, 
love, care and respect. For instance, parents cooking food

The monetary value of ₹400 (₹1,000 - ₹600) that Rajesh earns is a result of his added value to the wood.","A carpenter adds value to wood by using their skill, time, and effort to transform it into furniture, like a chair, which can then be sold for a higher price than the cost of the raw wood.

Let us take the example of Kavya’s father , Rajesh, to 
understand this.
Rajesh is a carpenter who buys 
wood from a nearby market for 
₹600 to make furniture.
He uses special tools and 
other materials for building the 
furniture.
Rajesh sells a chair for ₹1,000 
each in the market.
The wood for the chair costs ₹600. So, what is the remaining 
₹400 (₹1,000 – ₹600) for? It is the monetary value of Rajesh’s 
skill, time and effort, which went into making that chair . 
Rajesh has added value to the wood by turning it into 
furniture. From buying the wood to selling the chair , these 
activities involve payment. They are, therefore, a part of 
economic activities.

How do the three sectors depend on each other?,"Based on the given context, here is the answer:

The three sectors - primary, secondary, and tertiary - depend on each other in the following ways:

1. The secondary sector depends on the tertiary sector as follows:
   Examples: 
   * A textile mill (secondary sector) needs a supplier of raw materials like cotton or polyester (tertiary sector), which may be obtained from a trading company.
   * A steel factory (secondary sector) requires electricity and other services, which are provided by utility companies (tertiary sector).

These dependencies can be illustrated using flow diagrams.
","According to the given context, the primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors are interdependent. The secondary sector relies on the tertiary sector for essential services and raw materials. For example, a textile mill (secondary sector) depends on a trading company (tertiary sector) to supply raw materials like cotton or polyester. Similarly, a steel factory (secondary sector) requires electricity and other essential services provided by utility companies (tertiary sector). These dependencies can be effectively illustrated through flow diagrams to show the interconnected nature of economic activities.

How does livestock rearing contribute to the economy?,"Based on the provided context, livestock rearing contributes to the economy by:

* Providing milk and other animal products for consumption
* Supporting dairy cooperatives that collect and process milk
* Enabling trade and commerce through the exchange of goods and services
* Generating income for pastoralists through the sale of their cattle and sheep
* Supporting the livelihoods of many people, including farmers, traders, and laborers

Note: The context does not provide specific information on the exact economic contribution of livestock rearing.","Livestock rearing contributes to the economy by allowing the government to collect taxes directly from pastoralists. Cattle herders are required to show a pass and pay tax based on the number of cattle they own to enter grazing tracts.

In the 1920s, a Royal Commission on
Agriculture reported:
‘The extent of the area available for
grazing has gone down tremendously
with the extension of area under
cultivation because of increasing
population, extension of irrigation
facilities, acquiring the pastures for
Government purposes, for example,
defence, industries and agricultural

earnings have gone down. The quality

and became labourers, working on fields or in small towns.
Yet, pastoralists not only continue to survive, in many regions
their numbers have expanded over recent decades. When
pasturelands in one place was closed to them, they changed the
direction of their movement, reduced the size of the herd, combined

increased tremendously. For example, earlier most people 
were involved in activities such as agriculture, livestock 
rearing, production of tools, pottery and weaving cloth. 
As societies progressed, the number of economic activities 
through which people earn their livelihoods increased 
vastly.
Today, there are diverse economic activities such as 
manufacturing computers, mobile phones and drones; 
working in banks, schools and hotels; driving various types 
of vehicles for transportation; making furniture; tailoring 
clothes using machines; creating software; repairing 
refrigerators and washing machines; etc. Classifying all

How do farmers depend on secondary and tertiary sectors?,"Based on the provided context, farmers depend on secondary and tertiary sectors in the following ways:

Farmers sell their farm produce to factories or markets, which is an example of interdependence between the primary sector (farming) and the tertiary sector (market). The fruit or vegetable vendors who buy from the farmers are a part of the tertiary sector.

Additionally, farmers may also rely on services provided by technicians, mechanics, and electricians, which are all part of the tertiary sector. These services help maintain and repair equipment used in farming, such as tractors and irrigation systems.","The provided context does not explicitly detail how farmers depend on the secondary and tertiary sectors.

What happens if one economic sector stops functioning?,"Based on the context, if one economic sector stops functioning, it would have a ripple effect on other sectors. For example, if the primary sector (farm to factory or market) stopped functioning, it could impact the secondary sector (manufacturing and production), as there might be no raw materials available for processing. Similarly, the tertiary sector (services like communication, software development, etc.) might also be affected, as these services rely on the primary and secondary sectors for their operations.

Answer: It would have a ripple effect on other sectors, impacting the availability of resources and services.","If one economic sector stops functioning, based on the context, the other sectors would be affected due to their interdependence. Specifically, if the farm to factory/market chain breaks down, fruit and vegetable vendors would have nothing to sell to household consumers.

and capital from one region to another.
However, in the areas conquered, the reactions of the local
populations to French rule were mixed. Initially, in many places such
as Holland and Switzerland, as well as in certain cities like Brussels,
Mainz, Milan and Warsaw, the French armies were welcomed as
harbingers of liberty. But the initial enthusiasm soon turned to hostility,
as it became clear that the new administrative arrangements did not
go hand in hand with political freedom. Increased taxation,

6  India and the World of Print
Let us see when printing began in India and how ideas and information
were written before the age of print.
6.1 Manuscripts Before the Age of Print
India had a very rich and old tradition of handwritten manuscripts –
in Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, as well as in various vernacular languages.
Manuscripts were copied on palm leaves or on handmade paper.
Pages were sometimes beautifully illustrated. They would be either
pressed between wooden covers or sewn together to ensure
preservation. Manuscripts continued to be produced till well after
the introduction of print, down to the late nineteenth century.
Manuscripts, however, were highly expensive and fragile. They had
to be handled carefully
, and they  could not be read easily as the

Why did historians rely more on textual records over time?,"According to the context, historians relied more on textual records over time because the British believed in the importance of writing and kept detailed official records. This administrative culture produced memos, notings, and reports that were carefully preserved in record rooms attached to administrative institutions.","Based on the provided text, historians relied more on textual records over time because the British administration believed writing was important and meticulously documented everything. This led to a vast accumulation of records in administrative institutions, archives, and museums.
","INTRODUCTION: HOW, WHEN AND WHERE         5
How do We Know?
What sources do historians use in writing about the last 
250 years of Indian history? 
Administration produces records
One important source is the official records of the British 
administration. The British believed that the act of writing 
was important. Every instruction, plan, policy decision, 
agreement, investigation had to be clearly written up. Once 
this was done, things could be properly studied and debated. 
This conviction produced an administrative culture of 
memos, notings and reports. 
The British also felt that all important documents 
and letters needed to be carefully preserved. So they 
set up record rooms attached to all administrative 
institutions. The village tahsildar’s office, the collectorate, 
the commissioner’s office, the provincial secretariats, 
the lawcourts – all had their record rooms. Specialised 
institutions like archives and museums were also 
established to preserve important records.","2 OUR PASTS – III
All such historical questions refer us back to 
notions of time. But time does not have to be always 
precisely dated in terms of a particular year or a month. 
Sometimes it is actually incorrect to fix precise dates 
to processes that happen over a period of time. People 
in India did not begin drinking tea one fine day; they 
developed a taste for it over time. There can be no 
one clear date for a process such as this. Similarly, 
we cannot fix one single date on which British rule 
was established, or the national movement started, or 
changes took place within the economy and society. All 
these things happened over a stretch of time. We can 
only refer to a span of time, an approximate period over 
which particular changes became visible.
Why, then, do we continue to associate history with 
a string of dates? This association has a reason. There 
was a time when history was an account of battles and big","Introduction: 
How, When and Where

How Important are Dates?
There was a time when historians were 
fascinated with dates. There were heated 
debates about the dates on which rulers 
were crowned or battles were fought. In 
the common-sense notion, history was 
synonymous with dates. You may have 
heard people say, “I find history boring 
because it is all about memorising 
dates.” Is such a conception true?
History is certainly about changes 
that occur over time. It is about 
finding out how things were in the 
past and how things have changed. 
As soon as we compare the past with 
the present, we refer to time, we talk of 
“before” and “after”. 
Living in the world we do not always 
ask historical questions about what 
we see around us. We take things for 
granted, as if what we see has always 
been in the world we inhabit. But most of 
us have our moments of wonder, when we are 
curious, and we ask questions that actually are historical."
What are manuscripts?,"Based on the context, manuscripts refer to handwritten documents or texts. In those days, there was no printing press, and people copied manuscripts by hand. As scribes copied these manuscripts, they introduced small changes over centuries of copying, which led to differences between original and copied versions.","Manuscripts are texts that were copied by hand, often containing holy texts, chronicles of rulers, letters and teachings of saints, petitions and judicial records, and registers of accounts and taxes.

Why was hand labour preferred over machines in Britain?,"According to the context, hand labor was preferred over machines in Britain because there was no shortage of human labor. Industrialists did not want to introduce machines that would get rid of human labor and require large capital investment. Additionally, many industries had seasonal demands, so they preferred to hire workers for a specific period rather than investing in machinery.","In Victorian Britain, hand labour was preferred over machines due to the following reasons:

*   **Abundance of Labour:** There was no shortage of human labour as poor peasants and vagrants moved to cities in search of jobs.
*   **Low Wages:** With plenty of labour available, wages were low, so industrialists didn't face labour shortages or high wage costs.
*   **Seasonal Demand:** Many industries had seasonal demands for labour, making it more cost-effective to employ workers for specific periods.
*   **Preference for Handmade Goods:** The upper classes valued handmade products as symbols of refinement and class.
*   **Handicraft Survival:** Handicrafts actually expanded in the 20th century because of technological changes.","India and the Contemporary World

hammers were produced and 45 kinds of  axes. These required
human skill, not mechanical technology.
In Victorian Britain, the upper classes – the aristocrats and the
bourgeoisie – preferred things produced by hand. Handmade
products came to symbolise refinement and class. They were better
finished, individually produced, and carefully designed. Machine-
made goods were for export to the colonies.
In countries with labour shortage, industrialists were keen on using
mechanical power so that the need for human labour can be
minimised. This was the case in nineteenth-century America. Britain,
however, had no problem hiring human hands.
2.1 Life of the Workers
The abundance of labour in the market affected the lives of workers.

tramped to the cities. The actual possibility of getting a job depended
on existing networks of  friendship and kin relations. If you had

The  Age  of  Industrialisation
2  Hand Labour and Steam Power
In Victorian Britain there was no shortage of human labour. Poor
peasants and vagrants moved to the cities in large numbers in search
of jobs, waiting for work. As you will know, when there is plenty of
labour, wages are low. So industrialists had no pr
oblem of labour
shortage or high wage costs. They did not want to introduce machines
that got rid of human labour and required large capital investment.
In many industries the demand for labour was seasonal. Gas works
and breweries were especially busy through the cold months. So
they needed more workers to meet their peak demand.  Book-
binders and printers, catering to Christmas demand, too needed
extra hands before December. At the waterfront, winter was the
time that ships were repaired and spruced up. In all such industries
where production fluctuated with the season, industrialists usually
preferred hand labour, employing workers for the season.","about 67 per cent in 1911 – were located in Bengal and Bombay.
Over the rest of the country
, small-scale production continued to
predominate. Only a small proportion of the total industrial labour
force worked in registered factories: 5 per cent in 1911 and 10 per
cent in 1931. The rest worked in small workshops and household
units, often located in alleys and bylanes, invisible to the passer-by.
In fact, in some instances, handicrafts production actually expanded
in the twentieth century. This is true even in the case of the handloom
sector that we have discussed. While cheap machine-made thread
wiped out the spinning industry in the nineteenth century, the weavers
survived, despite problems. In the twentieth century, handloom
cloth production expanded steadily: almost trebling between 1900
and 1940.
How did this happen?
This was partly because of technological changes. Handicrafts people

Their grazing grounds shrank, their movements were regulated,
and the revenue they had to pay increased. Their agricultural stock
declined and their trades and crafts were adversely affected. How?
First, the colonial state wanted to transform all grazing lands
into cultivated farms. Land revenue was one of the main sources
of its finance. By expanding cultivation it could increase its revenue
collection. It could at the same time produce more jute, cotton,
wheat and other agricultural produce that were required in
England. To colonial officials all uncultivated land appeared to
be unproductive: it produced neither revenue nor agricultural
produce. It was seen as ‘waste land’ that needed to be brought
under cultivation. From the mid-nineteenth century, Waste Land

hammers were produced and 45 kinds of  axes. These required
human skill, not mechanical technology.
In Victorian Britain, the upper classes – the aristocrats and the
bourgeoisie – preferred things produced by hand. Handmade
products came to symbolise refinement and class. They were better
finished, individually produced, and carefully designed. Machine-
made goods were for export to the colonies.
In countries with labour shortage, industrialists were keen on using
mechanical power so that the need for human labour can be
minimised. This was the case in nineteenth-century America. Britain,
however, had no problem hiring human hands.
2.1 Life of the Workers
The abundance of labour in the market affected the lives of workers.
As news of possible jobs travelled to the countryside, hundreds
tramped to the cities. The actual possibility of getting a job depended
on existing networks of  friendship and kin relations. If you had
a relative or a friend in a f","about 67 per cent in 1911 – were located in Bengal and Bombay.
Over the rest of the country
, small-scale production continued to
predominate. Only a small proportion of the total industrial labour
force worked in registered factories: 5 per cent in 1911 and 10 per
cent in 1931. The rest worked in small workshops and household
units, often located in alleys and bylanes, invisible to the passer-by.
In fact, in some instances, handicrafts production actually expanded
in the twentieth century. This is true even in the case of the handloom
sector that we have discussed. While cheap machine-made thread
wiped out the spinning industry in the nineteenth century, the weavers
survived, despite problems. In the twentieth century, handloom
cloth production expanded steadily: almost trebling between 1900
and 1940.
How did this happen?
This was partly because of technological changes. Handicrafts people
adopt new tec hnology if  that helps them impr ove production","85
The  Age  of  Industrialisation
2  Hand Labour and Steam Power
In Victorian Britain there was no shortage of human labour. Poor
peasants and vagrants moved to the cities in large numbers in search
of jobs, waiting for work. As you will know, when there is plenty of
labour, wages are low. So industrialists had no pr
oblem of labour
shortage or high wage costs. They did not want to introduce machines
that got rid of human labour and required large capital investment.
In many industries the demand for labour was seasonal. Gas works
and breweries were especially busy through the cold months. So
they needed more workers to meet their peak demand.  Book-
binders and printers, catering to Christmas demand, too needed
extra hands before December. At the waterfront, winter was the
time that ships were repaired and spruced up. In all such industries
where production fluctuated with the season, industrialists usually
preferred hand labour, employing workers for the season."

in their language of ‘Sindhu’. (Note that in ancient Persian, 
‘Hindu’ is a purely geographical term; it does not refer here 
to the Hindu religion.)

the region ‘Indoi’ or  ‘Indike’. They dropped the initial letter

products came to symbolise refinement and class. They were better
finished, individually produced, and carefully designed. Machine-
made goods were for export to the colonies.
In countries with labour shortage, industrialists were keen on using
mechanical power so that the need for human labour can be
minimised. This was the case in nineteenth-century America. Britain,
however, had no problem hiring human hands.

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, merchants from the towns
in Europe began moving to the countryside, supplying money to
peasants and artisans, persuading them to produce for an international
market. With the expansion of world trade and the acquisition of
colonies in different parts of the world, the demand for goods
began growing. But merchants could not expand production within
towns. This was because here urban crafts and trade guilds were
powerful. These were associations of producers that trained
craftspeople, maintained control over production, regulated
competition and prices, and restricted the entry of new people into
the trade. Rulers granted different guilds the monopoly
right to produce and trade in specific products. It was
therefore difficult for new merchants to set up
business in towns. So they turned to the countryside.

All such historical questions refer us back to 
notions of time. But time does not have to be always 
precisely dated in terms of a particular year or a month. 
Sometimes it is actually incorrect to fix precise dates 
to processes that happen over a period of time. People 
in India did not begin drinking tea one fine day; they 
developed a taste for it over time. There can be no 
one clear date for a process such as this. Similarly, 
we cannot fix one single date on which British rule 
was established, or the national movement started, or 
changes took place within the economy and society. All 
these things happened over a stretch of time. We can 
only refer to a span of time, an approximate period over 
which particular changes became visible.
Why, then, do we continue to associate history with 
a string of dates? This association has a reason. There 
was a time when history was an account of battles and big"
Why do historians study economic and social factors along with political changes?,"According to the context, historians study economic and social factors along with political changes because they believe in bringing elements from diverse fields together (multidisciplinarity), which enriches their perspective. This approach helps them understand the complexities of history and prepares a better future by exploring society.","The provided context suggests that historians study economic and social factors along with political changes because life constantly mixes numerous elements together, and bringing elements from diverse fields together enriches our perspective. This approach, called ""multidisciplinarity,"" helps in making sense of the present and preparing for a better future.

Tapestry of the Past
remember them all now; we will use some of them as we go 
along. When historians study, say, a king or queen of 1,500 
years ago, an ancient monument, a war or some items of 
trade, they take great care to gather information from as 
many sources as they can find and consult. Sometimes, the 
sources confirm each other (the jigsaw pieces match); at 
other times, sources may give contradictory information 
(the jigsaw pieces don’t match), in which case they need to 
decide which source they can trust more. That is how they 
try to re-create the history of the period they are studying.
Who contributes to all these sources of history? Historians 
themselves, but also archaeologists, epigraphists (who 
study ancient inscriptions), anthropologists (who study 
human societies and their cultures), experts in literature 
and languages, and some more. In addition, in the last 50","also explains the presence of ‘Big Questions’ at the start of

some ancient Tamil poetry in chapters that apparently deal 
with geography; a discussion on the uses of the sari in a 
chapter on cultural heritage; the concept of sevā and the 
mention of festivals in chapters focusing on economics. 
This is deliberate. We believe in bringing elements from 
diverse fields together (you will learn later that this is 
called ‘multidisciplinarity’). This enriches our perspective. 
Indeed, life constantly mixes numerous elements together , 
so why should we not?
By now, it should be clear that although Social Science 
makes constant use of the past, it seeks to make sense of 
the present so as to help us prepare a better future. It is an 
exploration and an adventure.

focus. We move between a close focus on particular communities and regions to the
history of the nation; between the histories as they unfold in India and Europe to the
developments in Africa and Indonesia.  Our focus will shift according
to themes.
What are these themes and how are they organised? What is the logic behind the
choices of themes?
All too often in the past, the history of the modern world was associated with the
history of the west. It was as if change and progress happened only in the west. As if
the histories of other countries were frozen in time, they were motionless and static.
People in the west were seen as enterprising, innovative, scientific, industrious, efficient
and willing to change. People in the east - or in Africa and South America - were
considered traditional, lazy, superstitious, and resistant to change."
How did the arrival of European traders impact India?,"According to the context, the arrival of European traders impacted India by:

* The fine qualities of Indian cotton and silk being in great demand in Europe, which led to competition among trading companies and pushed up prices.
* The trading companies' urge to secure markets leading to fierce battles between them, including sinking each other's ships, blockading routes, and preventing rival ships from moving with supplies.

In summary, the arrival of European traders had an impact on India's economy and trade, primarily due to competition among trading companies.","The arrival of European traders in India led to increased competition among them for Indian goods like cotton, silk, pepper, cloves, cardamom, and cinnamon, driving up prices and reducing profits. This competition resulted in fierce battles, sinking of ships, blockades, and prevention of rival ships from moving with supplies as the companies sought to eliminate competitors and secure markets.
","By the time the first English ships sailed down the 
west coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and 
crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already 
established their presence in the western coast of India, 
and had their base in Goa. In fact, it was Vasco da 
Gama, a Portuguese explorer, who had discovered this 
sea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth 
century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities 
of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders 
arrived on the scene. 
The problem was that all the companies were 
interested in buying the same things. The fine qualities 
of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market 
in Europe. Pepper, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon 
too were in great demand. Competition amongst the 
European companies inevitably pushed up the prices 
at which these goods could be purchased, and this 
reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way 
the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating","at which these goods could be purchased, and this

What happened to big landlords and warrior chiefs by the seventh century?,"According to the context, by the seventh century, big landlords and warrior chiefs lost power or relevance. This is implied by the fact that nobility, the crown, and the Orthodox Church owned large properties, and powerful men often rented out their land instead of cultivating it themselves. Additionally, many tribal groups settled down and began cultivating their fields in one place year after year, which suggests a shift away from traditional warrior-chief systems.","By the seventh century, some forest-dwellers started tilling the land and became peasants.

Even before the nineteenth century, many from within 
the tribal groups had begun settling  down, and

instead of moving from place to place. They began 
to use the plough, and gradually got rights over the 
land they lived on. In many cases, like the Mundas of 
Chottanagpur, the land belonged to the clan as a whole. 
All members of the clan were regarded as descendants 
of the original settlers, who had first cleared the land. 
Therefore, all of them had rights on the land. Very 
often some people within the clan acquired more power 
than others, some became chiefs and others followers.

How did landlords gain independence from their overlords?,"According to the context, landlords (zamindars) gained independence from their overlords with the introduction of the Permanent Settlement by Charles Cornwallis in 1806.

They could focus on collecting revenue without investing in the land, making them less dependent on their previous overlords.","With the Permanent Settlement introduced by Charles Cornwallis in 1806, zamindars gained independence from their overlords.

been fixed permanently.
Even then the zamindars did not have an interest 
in improving the land. Some had lost their lands in 
the earlier years of the settlement; others now saw the 
possibility of earning without the trouble and risk of 
investment. As long as the zamindars could give out the 
land to tenants and get rent, they were not interested in 
improving the land.

groups to settle down and become peasant cultivators. 
Settled peasants were easier to control and administer 
than people who were always on the move. The British 
also wanted a regular revenue source for the state. 
So they introduced land settlements – that is, they 
measured the land, defined the rights of each individual 
to that land, and fixed the revenue demand for the 
state. Some peasants were declared landowners, others 
tenants. As you have seen (Chapter 2), the tenants were 
to pay rent to the landowner who in turn paid revenue 
to the state.
The British effort to settle jhum cultivators was not 
very successful. Settled plough cultivation is not easy in 
areas where water is scarce and the soil is dry. In fact, 
jhum cultivators who took to plough cultivation often 
suffered, since their fields did not produce good yields.

Deliberations on jati 
A twelfth-century inscription from Uyyakondan Udaiyar, 
in Tiruchirapalli taluka (in present-day Tamil Nadu), 
describes the deliberations in a sabha (Chapter 2) of 
Brahmanas. 
They deliberated on the status of a group known as 
rathakaras (literally, chariot makers). They laid down 
their occupations, which were to include architecture, 
building coaches and chariots, erecting gateways 
for temples with images in them, preparing wooden 
equipment used to perform sacrifices, building 
mandapas, making jewels for the king.

Why did seasonal industries prefer hand labour?,"Seasonal industries preferred hand labour because they needed more workers to meet their peak demand during certain times of the year. For example, gas works and breweries were busier during cold months, while bookbinders and printers needed extra hands before Christmas. This fluctuation in production required a flexible workforce that could be hired seasonally, making hand labour a more suitable option for these industries.","In seasonal industries, industrialists preferred hand labour because production fluctuated with the season, and they employed workers only for the season.
","85
The  Age  of  Industrialisation
2  Hand Labour and Steam Power
In Victorian Britain there was no shortage of human labour. Poor
peasants and vagrants moved to the cities in large numbers in search
of jobs, waiting for work. As you will know, when there is plenty of
labour, wages are low. So industrialists had no pr
oblem of labour
shortage or high wage costs. They did not want to introduce machines
that got rid of human labour and required large capital investment.
In many industries the demand for labour was seasonal. Gas works
and breweries were especially busy through the cold months. So
they needed more workers to meet their peak demand.  Book-
binders and printers, catering to Christmas demand, too needed
extra hands before December. At the waterfront, winter was the
time that ships were repaired and spruced up. In all such industries
where production fluctuated with the season, industrialists usually
preferred hand labour, employing workers for the season.","India and the Contemporary World
86
hammers were produced and 45 kinds of  axes. These required
human skill, not mechanical technology.
In Victorian Britain, the upper classes – the aristocrats and the
bourgeoisie – preferred things produced by hand. Handmade
products came to symbolise refinement and class. They were better
finished, individually produced, and carefully designed. Machine-
made goods were for export to the colonies.
In countries with labour shortage, industrialists were keen on using
mechanical power so that the need for human labour can be
minimised. This was the case in nineteenth-century America. Britain,
however, had no problem hiring human hands.
2.1 Life of the Workers
The abundance of labour in the market affected the lives of workers.
As news of possible jobs travelled to the countryside, hundreds
tramped to the cities. The actual possibility of getting a job depended
on existing networks of  friendship and kin relations. If you had
a relative or a friend in a f","about 67 per cent in 1911 – were located in Bengal and Bombay.
Over the rest of the country
, small-scale production continued to
predominate. Only a small proportion of the total industrial labour
force worked in registered factories: 5 per cent in 1911 and 10 per
cent in 1931. The rest worked in small workshops and household
units, often located in alleys and bylanes, invisible to the passer-by.
In fact, in some instances, handicrafts production actually expanded
in the twentieth century. This is true even in the case of the handloom
sector that we have discussed. While cheap machine-made thread
wiped out the spinning industry in the nineteenth century, the weavers
survived, despite problems. In the twentieth century, handloom
cloth production expanded steadily: almost trebling between 1900
and 1940.
How did this happen?
This was partly because of technological changes. Handicrafts people
adopt new tec hnology if  that helps them impr ove production"
What kind of claims did rulers make in their prashastis?,"According to the context, rulers made claims in their prashastis about their achievements, such as:

* The exploits of Nagabhata, a Pratihara king, including victories over other kingdoms and princes.
* Establishment and construction of temples.

These claims were likely made to depict the ruler as a valiant and victorious warrior, which was how they wanted to be perceived.","Rulers made claims of being valiant, victorious warriors in their prashastis.

What led to the rise of factories in India?,"According to the context, the rise of factories in India was led by European Agencies such as Bird Heiglers & Co., Andrew Yule, and Jardine Skinner & Co. These agencies mobilized capital, set up joint-stock companies, and managed them, with Indian financiers providing the capital while European agencies made all investment and business decisions.","The rise of factories in India was driven by the following factors:

*   **Demand for workers increased with the expansion of factories.** The number of factory workers grew significantly between 1901 and 1946.
*   **Peasants and artisans seeking work.** People from surrounding districts, unable to find work in villages, migrated to industrial centers.
*   **Mobilization of capital and establishment of companies:** European Agencies like Bird Heiglers & Co. set up joint-stock companies.
","industries in India started much later than
textiles. In colonial India industrial machinery,
railways and locomotives were mostly imported.
So capital goods industries could not really
develop in any significant way till Independence.

& Co. These Agencies mobilised capital, set up joint-stock companies
and managed them. In most instances Indian financiers provided
the capital while the European Agencies made all investment and
business decisions. The European merchant-industrialists had their
own chambers of commerce which Indian businessmen were not
allowed to join.
4.2 Where Did the Workers Come From?
Factories needed workers. With the expansion of  factories, this
demand increased. In 1901, there were 584,000 workers in Indian
factories. By 1946 the number was over 2,436, 000. 
Where did the
workers come from?
 In most industrial regions workers came from the districts around.
Peasants and artisans who found no work in the village went to the
industrial centres in search of work. Over 50 per cent workers in the
Bombay cotton industries in 1911 came from the neighbouring
district of Ratnagiri, while the mills of Kanpur got most of their","India and the Contemporary World

Getting jobs was always difficult, even when mills multiplied and
the demand for workers increased. The numbers seeking work were
always more than the jobs available.  Entry into the mills was also
restricted. Industrialists usually employed a jobber to get new recruits.
Very often the jobber was an old and trusted worker. He got people
from his village, ensured them jobs, helped them settle in the city
and provided them money in times of crisis. The jobber therefore
became a per son with some authority and po wer. He be gan
demanding money and gifts for his favour and controlling the lives
of workers.
The number of factory workers increased over time. However,
as you will see, they were a small proportion of the total
industrial workforce.
Vasant Parkar, who was once a millworker in Bombay, said:
‘The workers would pay the jobbers money to get their sons work
in the mill … The mill worker was closely associated with his village,"
How did Chola temples become centers of economic life?,"According to the context, Chola temples became centers of economic life because they:

* Grew settlements around them, which were centers of craft production
* Were endowed with land by rulers and others, and the produce of this land went into maintaining temple specialists
* Served as a hub for various craftsmen, such as bronze image makers

These factors made temples not only places of worship but also centers of economic, social, and cultural life.","Chola temples became centers of economic life because they were endowed with land, and the produce from this land supported the specialists who worked at the temple. This included priests, garland makers, cooks, sweepers, musicians, and dancers, who often lived near the temple, making it a nucleus of settlement and craft production.

These associations were known as urban crafts and trade guilds that trained craftspeople and maintained control over specific products, making it difficult for new merchants to set up business in towns.","In Chola towns, trader associations controlled production, regulated competition and prices, and restricted new entrants. Known as urban crafts and trade guilds, they trained craftspeople and maintained control over specific products, limiting opportunities for new merchants.
","period onwards, we have records of adivasi communities trading
elephants and other goods like hides, horns, silk cocoons, ivory,
bamboo, spices, fibres, grasses, gums and resins through nomadic
communities like the Banjaras.
With the coming of the British, however, trade was completely
regulated by the government. The British government gave many
large European trading firms the sole right to trade in the forest
products of particular areas. Grazing and hunting by local people
were restricted. In the process, many pastoralist and nomadic
communities like the Korava, Karacha and Yerukula of the Madras
Presidency lost their livelihoods. Some of them began to be called
‘criminal tribes’, and were forced to work instead in factories,
mines and plantations, under government supervision.
New opportunities of work did not always mean improved well-
being for the people. In Assam, both men and women from forest
communities like Santhals and Oraons from Jharkhand, and","through the main pr

connected India to the Gulf and Red Sea Ports; Masulipatam on
the Coromandel coast  and Hoogly in Bengal had trade links with
Southeast Asian ports.
A variety of Indian merchants and bankers were involved in this
network of export trade – financing production, carrying goods
and supplying exporters. Supply merchants linked the port towns to
the inland regions. They gave advances to weavers, procured the
woven cloth from weaving villages, and carried the supply to the
ports. At the port, the big shippers and export merchants had brokers
who negotiated the price and bought goods from the supply
merchants operating inland.
By the 1750s this network, controlled by Indian merchants, was

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, merchants from the towns
in Europe began moving to the countryside, supplying money to
peasants and artisans, persuading them to produce for an international
market. With the expansion of world trade and the acquisition of
colonies in different parts of the world, the demand for goods
began growing. But merchants could not expand production within
towns. This was because here urban crafts and trade guilds were
powerful. These were associations of producers that trained
craftspeople, maintained control over production, regulated
competition and prices, and restricted the entry of new people into
the trade. Rulers granted different guilds the monopoly
right to produce and trade in specific products. It was
therefore difficult for new merchants to set up
business in towns. So they turned to the countryside.

Contemporary historians and travellers give very

they preserved rich customs and oral traditions. These 
were passed down to each new generation. Present-
day historians have started using such oral traditions 
to write tribal histories. 
Tribal people were found in almost every region of

controlled large territories. In Punjab, the Khokhar

that is now known as India. After his death in 1707, 
many Mughal governors (subadars) and big zamindars

kingdoms. As powerful regional kingdoms emerged in 
various parts of India, Delhi could no longer function as

Why did Indian textiles face competition from Manchester cloth?,"Indian textiles faced competition from Manchester cloth because the goods from Manchester were cheap and durable, making it impossible for Indian manufactures to compete.

Cotton weavers in India thus faced two problems at the same time:
their export market collapsed, and the local market shrank, being
glutted with Manchester imports. Produced by machines at lower
costs, the imported cotton goods were so cheap that weavers could
not easily compete with them. By the 1850s, reports from most
weaving regions of India narrated stories of decline and desolation.

In many places in Carnatic and Bengal, weavers deserted villages
and migrated, setting up looms in other villages where they had
some family relation. Elsewhere, weavers along with the village
traders revolted, opposing the Company and its officials. Over time
many weavers began refusing loans, closing down their workshops
and taking to agricultural labour.
By the turn of the nineteenth century, cotton weavers faced a
new set of problems.
3.3 Manchester Comes to India
In 1772, Henry Patullo, a Company official, had ventured to
say that the demand for Indian textiles could never reduce, since
no other nation produced goods of the same quality. Yet by
the beginning of the nineteenth century we see the beginning of
a long decline of textile exports from India. In 1811-12
piece-goods accounted for 33 per cent of India’s exports; by
1850-51 it was no more than 3 per cent.
Why did this happen? What were its implications?"

What were gender distinctions used for in society?,"According to the context, gender distinctions were used to justify the division of labor and responsibilities between men and women. Chaumette's argument was that nature had assigned domestic duties to women, such as nurturing babies, while men were meant for activities like hunting, agriculture, and politics. This justification was used to maintain the social status quo and restrict women's participation in public life, including political rights.","Based on the provided text, gender distinctions were used to:

*   **Assign domestic duties to women and political duties to men.** Chaumette argues that nature entrusted household duties and motherhood to women, while men were assigned hunting, agriculture, and political duties.
*   **Exclude women from political rights.** The right to vote was granted exclusively to property-owning men, excluding all women.
*   **Reduce women to a minor status.** The Napoleonic Code reduced women to the status of a minor, subject to the authority of fathers and husbands.","other distinction than that of their talents.

Compare the manifesto drafted by Olympe de
Gouges (Source F) with the Declaration of the
Rights of Man and Citizen (Source C).
In 1793, the Jacobin politician Chaumette
sought to justify the closure of women’s

‘Has Nature entrusted domestic duties to
men? Has she given us breasts to nurture
babies?
No.
She said to Man:
Be a man. Hunting, agriculture, political duties

She said to Woman:

St Domingue in the Caribbean 
islands. The African slaves who 
worked on the plantations rose 
in rebellion in 1791, burning 
the plantations and killing their 
rich planters. In 1792, France 
abolished slavery in the French 
colonies. These events led to the 
collapse of the indigo plantations

From Meerut to Delhi
On 8 April 1857, a young soldier, Mangal Pandey, was hanged 
to death for attacking his officers in Barrackpore. Some days 
later, some sepoys of the regiment at Meerut refused to do the

The  Making  of  a  Global  World
1  The Pre-modern World
When we talk of ‘globalisation’ we often refer to an economic
system that has emerged since the last 50 years or so. But as you will
see in this chapter, the making of the global world has a long
history – of trade, of migration, of people in search of work, the
movement of capital, and much else. As we think about the dramatic
and visible signs of global interconnectedness in our lives today,
we need to understand the phases through which this world in
which we live has emerged.
All through history, human societies have become steadily more
interlinked. From ancient times, travellers, traders, priests and
pilgrims travelled vast distances for knowledge, opportunity and
spiritual fulfilment, or to escape persecution. They carried goods,
money
, values, skills, ideas, inventions, and even germs and diseases.
As early as 3000 BCE an active coastal trade linked the Indus valley","57
The  Making  of  a  Global  World
The world changed profoundly in the nineteenth century. Economic,
political, social, cultural and technological factors interacted in
complex ways to transform societies and reshape external relations.
Economists identify three types of movement or ‘flows’ within
international economic exchanges. 
The first is the flow of trade which
in the nineteenth century referred largely to trade in goods (e.g.,
cloth or wheat). The second is the flow of labour – the migration
of people in search of employment. The third is the movement of
capital for short-term or long-term investments over long distances.
All three flows were closely interwoven and affected peoples’ lives
more deeply now than ever before. The interconnections could
sometimes be broken – for example, labour migration was often
more restricted than goods or capital flows. Yet it helps us understand
the nineteenth-century world economy better if we look at the
three flows together."
How were iqtas (territories) controlled?,"According to the context, iqtas (territories) were controlled by a system of governance outlined in the Arthaśhāstra, where a whole administrative structure was put in place from the village to the regional capital. This included the management and development of villages and local areas through institutions governed by states.","
According to the context, iqtas (territories) were governed through a system described in the Arthaśhāstra, establishing an administrative structure from villages to regional capitals, managing local development through state-run institutions.","States. This is because the States have authority over 
those institutions. But their objectives are the same 
— it is to enable villagers to take an active part in the 
management and development of their villages and 
the local area. 
The Arthaśhāstra is an ancient text of governance written 
by Kauṭilya (later also known as Chāṇakya) some 2,300 
years ago. Among other things, it describes how a state 
should be structured and run, how the economy can be 
made prosperous, what the duties of the ruler are and 
how to conduct war. Kauṭilya, an expert in statecraft, also 
explains how a whole administrative structure should be 
put in place from the village to the regional capital:

As the Delhi Sultans brought the hinterland of

to accept their authority. Under Alauddin Khalji the 
state brought the assessment and collection of land 
revenue under its own control. The rights of the local 
chieftains to levy taxes were cancelled and they were 
also forced to pay taxes. The Sultan’s administrators 
measured the land and kept careful accounts. Some of 
the old chieftains and landlords served the Sultanate 
as revenue collectors and assessors. There were 
three types of taxes: (1) on cultivation called

Canning decided that Bahadur Shah Zafar would be 
the last Mughal king and after his death none of his 
descendants would be recognised as kings – they would 
just be called princes.
The peasants and the sepoys
In the countryside, peasants and zamindars resented 
the high taxes and the rigid methods of revenue 
collection. Many failed to pay back their loans to the 
moneylenders and gradually lost the lands they had 
tilled for generations. 
The Indian sepoys in the employ of the Company 
also had reasons for discontent. They were unhappy 
about their pay, allowances and conditions of service. 
Some of the new rules, moreover, violated their religious 
sensibilities and beliefs. Did you know that in those 
days many people in the country believed that if they 
crossed the sea they would lose their religion and caste? 
So when in 1824, the sepoys were told to go to Burma 
by the sea route to fight for the Company, they refused"
What was the role of Afghan and Rajput rulers after the Delhi Sultanate?,"According to the context, after the Delhi Sultanate, Afghan and Rajput rulers established their independent rule in various regions. They were able to do so because some areas were forested or mountainous, making it difficult for Sultanate forces to penetrate and maintain control. These local chieftains, including Afghans and Rajputs, set up their own fortifications and defense systems to protect their territories.","Following the Delhi Sultanate, Afghan and Rajput rulers emerged, establishing independent rule in regions like Bengal, Malwa, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. The context mentions the rise of these new ruling groups in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The Mongol attacks on the Delhi Sultanate forced the rulers to mobilise a large standing army in Delhi which posed a huge administrative challenge.

of revenue and military administration (diwani and 
faujdari) as well. This gave them extraordinary political, 
economic and military powers over vast regions of the 
Mughal Empire. As the governors consolidated their 
control over the provinces, the periodic remission of 
revenue to the capital declined.
Peasant and zamindari rebellions in many parts of 
northern and western India added to these problems. 
These revolts were sometimes caused by the pressures 
of mounting taxes. At other times they were attempts 
by powerful chieftains to consolidate their own 
positions. Mughal authority had been challenged by 
rebellious groups in the past as well. But these groups 
were now able to seize the economic resources of the 
region to consolidate their positions. The Mughal 
emperors after Aurangzeb were unable to arrest the 
gradual shifting of political and economic authority 
into the hands of provincial governors, local chieftains 
and other groups.","98

The worst possible humiliation came when two 
Mughal emperors, Farrukh Siyar (1713 –1719)

and

With the decline in the authority of the 
Mughal emperors, the governors of large  
provinces, subadars, and the great zamindars 
consolidated their authority in different parts 
of the subcontinent, such as Awadh, Bengal  
and Hyderabad. 
The Rajputs 
Many Rajput kings, particularly those belonging to 
Amber and Jodhpur, had served under the Mughals 
with distinction. In exchange, they were permitted to 
enjoy considerable autonomy in their watan jagirs. In 
the eighteenth century, these rulers now attempted to 
extend their control over adjacent regions. Ajit Singh, 
the ruler of Jodhpur, was also involved in the factional 
politics at the Mughal court."
How did deforestation occur during the expansion of the Delhi Sultanate?,"According to the context, deforestation occurred during the expansion of the Delhi Sultanate due to peasants extending the boundaries of cultivation, clearing forests and breaking new land as population increased and demand for food rose. This process began centuries ago and became more systematic and extensive under colonial rule.","The provided context does not directly explain how deforestation occurred during the expansion of the Delhi Sultanate. It mentions forested areas existed that Sultanate forces could not penetrate and that some land was measured and accounted for by Sultanate administrators.

The disappearance of forests is referred to as deforestation.
Deforestation is not a recent problem. The process began many
centuries ago; but under colonial rule it became more systematic and
extensive.  Let us look at some of the causes of deforestation in India.
1.1 Land to be Improved
In 1600, approximately one-sixth of India’s landmass was under
cultivation. Now that figure has gone up to about half. As population
increased over the centuries and the demand for food went up,
peasants extended the boundaries of cultivation, clearing forests and
breaking new land. In the colonial period, cultivation expanded
rapidly for a variety of reasons. First, the British directly encouraged

Mughal Relations with Other Rulers
The Mughal rulers campaigned constantly against 
rulers who refused to accept their authority. But as 
the Mughals became powerful many other rulers 
also joined them voluntarily. The Rajputs are a good 
example of this. Many of them married their daughters 
into Mughal families and received high positions. But

the Mughals created an empire and accomplished what 
had hitherto seemed possible for only short periods 
of time. From the latter half of the sixteenth century, 
they expanded their kingdom from Agra and Delhi,

all of the subcontinent. They imposed structures of

Who were the Mughals?
The Mughals were descendants 
of two great lineages of rulers. 
From their mother’s side they were 
descendants of Genghis Khan (died 
1227), the Mongol ruler who ruled 
over parts of China and Central 
Asia. From their father’s side, they 
were the successors of Timur (died 
1404), the ruler of Iran, Iraq and  
modern-day Turkey. However, 
the Mughals did not like to be 
called Mughal or Mongol. This was 
because Genghis Khan’s memory 
was associated with the massacre 
of innumerable people. It was also 
linked with the Uzbegs, their Mongol 
competitors. On the other hand, the 
Mughals were proud of their Timurid 
ancestry, not least of all because 
their great ancestor had captured 
They celebrated their genealogy 
pictorially, each ruler getting a 
picture made of Timur and himself.

economic and military powers over vast regions of the 
Mughal Empire. As the governors consolidated their 
control over the provinces, the periodic remission of 
revenue to the capital declined.
Peasant and zamindari rebellions in many parts of 
northern and western India added to these problems. 
These revolts were sometimes caused by the pressures 
of mounting taxes. At other times they were attempts 
by powerful chieftains to consolidate their own 
positions. Mughal authority had been challenged by 
rebellious groups in the past as well. But these groups 
were now able to seize the economic resources of the 
region to consolidate their positions. The Mughal 
emperors after Aurangzeb were unable to arrest the

What were the Silk Routes used for?,"According to the context, the Silk Routes were used for:

* Pre-modern trade and cultural links between distant parts of the world
* The exchange of goods such as Chinese silk, Indian textiles, spices, precious metals (gold and silver), and pottery
* The flow of ideas, culture, and people between Asia, Europe, and northern Africa
","The Silk Routes were used for trade and cultural exchange between distant parts of the world. Specifically, they facilitated the movement of Chinese silk, pottery, textiles, and spices from India and Southeast Asia to the West, and precious metals like gold and silver from Europe to Asia. They were also used by early Christian missionaries and Muslim preachers to travel to Asia.
","India and the Contemporary World

1.1 Silk Routes Link the World
The silk routes are a good example of vibrant pre-modern trade
and cultural links between distant parts of the world. The name ‘silk
routes’ points to the importance of West-bound Chinese silk cargoes
along this route. Historians have identified several silk routes, over
land and by sea, knitting together vast regions of Asia, and linking
Asia with Europe and northern Africa. They are known to have
existed since before the Christian Era and thrived almost till the
fifteenth century. But Chinese pottery also travelled the same route,
as did textiles and spices from India and Southeast Asia. In return,
precious metals – gold and silver – flowed from Europe to Asia.
Tr
ade and cultur al exchange always went hand in hand.  Early
Christian missionaries almost certainly travelled this route to Asia, as
did early Muslim preachers a few centuries later. Much before all","silk was in demand in European markets. 
The fine quality of Indian silk was highly 
valued and exports from India increased 
rapidly. As the market expanded, East India Company 
officials tried to encourage silk production to meet the 
growing demand. 
Hazaribagh, in present-day Jharkhand, was an area 
where the Santhals reared cocoons. The 
traders dealing in silk sent in their agents 
who gave loans to the tribal people and 
collected the cocoons. The growers 
were paid ` 3 to ` 4 for a thousand 
cocoons. These were then 
exported to Burdwan or 
Gaya where they were 
sold at five times the 
price. The middlemen 
– so called because 
they arranged deals 
between the exporters 
and silk growers – made 
huge profits. The silk  
growers earned very 
little. Understandably, 
many tribal groups saw 
the market and the 
traders as their main 
enemies.

would not be increased, the zamindar would benefit from

The problem
The Permanent Settlement, however, created problems. 
Company officials soon discovered that the zamindars 
were in fact not investing in the improvement of land. 
The revenue that had been fixed was so high that the 
zamindars found it difficult to pay. Anyone who failed 
to pay the revenue lost his zamindari. Numerous 
zamindaris were sold off at auctions organised by  
the Company.
By the first decade of the nineteenth century, the 
situation changed. The prices in the market rose and 
cultivation slowly expanded. This meant an increase in 
the income of the zamindars but no gain for the Company 
since it could not increase a revenue demand that had 
been fixed permanently.
Even then the zamindars did not have an interest 
in improving the land. Some had lost their lands in","us, the zamindars have risen to oppose us.”

Shah, a maulvi from Faizabad, prophesied that the rule

the imagination of the people and raised a huge force of 
supporters. He came to Lucknow to fight the British. In Delhi, 
a large number of ghazis or religious warriors came together 
to wipe out the white people. Bakht Khan, a soldier from 
Bareilly, took charge of a large force of fighters who came 
to Delhi. He became a key military leader of the uprising. 
In Bihar, an old zamindar, Kunwar Singh, joined the rebel 
sepoys and battled with the British for many months.

The ageing emperor had to accept this demand. He wrote 
letters to all the chiefs and rulers of the country to come 
forward and organise a confederacy of Indian states to fight 
the British. This single step taken by Bahadur Shah had 
great implications.
The Mughal dynasty had ruled over a very large 
part of the country. Most smaller rulers and chieftains 
controlled different territories on behalf of the Mughal 
ruler.  Threatened by the expansion of British rule, many 
of them felt that if the Mughal emperor could rule again, 
they too would be able to rule their own territories once 
more, under Mughal authority.  
The British had not expected this to happen. They thought 
the disturbance caused by the issue of the cartridges would die 
down. But Bahadur Shah Zafar’s decision to bless the uprising 
changed the entire situation dramatically. Often when people

faujdari) as well. This gave them extraordinary political, 
economic and military powers over vast regions of the 
Mughal Empire. As the governors consolidated their 
control over the provinces, the periodic remission of 
revenue to the capital declined.
Peasant and zamindari rebellions in many parts of 
northern and western India added to these problems. 
These revolts were sometimes caused by the pressures 
of mounting taxes. At other times they were attempts 
by powerful chieftains to consolidate their own 
positions. Mughal authority had been challenged by 
rebellious groups in the past as well. But these groups 
were now able to seize the economic resources of the 
region to consolidate their positions. The Mughal 
emperors after Aurangzeb were unable to arrest the 
gradual shifting of political and economic authority 
into the hands of provincial governors, local chieftains 
and other groups.","see how this came about.

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, merchants from the towns
in Europe began moving to the countryside, supplying money to
peasants and artisans, persuading them to produce for an international
market. With the expansion of world trade and the acquisition of
colonies in different parts of the world, the demand for goods
began growing. But merchants could not expand production within
towns. This was because here urban crafts and trade guilds were
powerful. These were associations of producers that trained
craftspeople, maintained control over production, regulated
competition and prices, and restricted the entry of new people into
the trade. Rulers granted different guilds the monopoly
right to produce and trade in specific products. It was
therefore difficult for new merchants to set up
business in towns. So they turned to the countryside.

The  Age  of  Industrialisation
2  Hand Labour and Steam Power
In Victorian Britain there was no shortage of human labour. Poor
peasants and vagrants moved to the cities in large numbers in search
of jobs, waiting for work. As you will know, when there is plenty of
labour, wages are low. So industrialists had no pr
oblem of labour
shortage or high wage costs. They did not want to introduce machines
that got rid of human labour and required large capital investment.
In many industries the demand for labour was seasonal. Gas works
and breweries were especially busy through the cold months. So

1  Before the Industrial Revolution
All too often we associate industrialisation with the growth of
factory industry. When we talk of  industrial pr

to factory production. When we talk of industrial workers we
mean factory workers. Histories of industrialisation very often begin
with the setting up of the first factories.
There is a problem with such ideas. Even before factories began to
dot the landscape in England and Europe, there was large-scale
industrial production for an international market. This was not based
on f actories . Many historians no w r efer to this phase of
industrialisation as proto-industrialisation.

","41 THE MUGHALS 
Mughal Traditions of Succession 
The Mughals did not believe in the rule of primogeniture, 
where the eldest son inherited his father’s estate. 
Instead they followed the Mughal and Timurid 
custom of coparcenary inheritance, or a division of 
the inheritance amongst all the sons. Which do you 
think is a fairer division of inheritance: primogeniture 
or coparcenary?
Mughal Relations with Other Rulers
The Mughal rulers campaigned constantly against 
rulers who refused to accept their authority. But as 
the Mughals became powerful many other rulers 
also joined them voluntarily. The Rajputs are a good 
example of this. Many of them married their daughters 
into Mughal families and received high positions. But 
many resisted as well.

The great lords are helpless and impoverished. Their peasants 
raise two crops a year, but their lords see nothing of either, and 
their agents on the spot are virtual prisoners in the peasants’ 
hands, like a peasant kept in his creditor’s house until he

How did peasant revolts weaken the Mughal Empire?,"Based on the provided context, peasant revolts weakened the Mughal Empire by:

* Causing periodic remission of revenue to the capital to decline, further eroding the empire's economic power
* Allowing rebellious groups to seize economic resources and consolidate their positions, which ultimately led to a gradual shifting of political and economic authority into the hands of provincial governors, local chieftains, and other groups.","Peasant and zamindari rebellions weakened the Mughal Empire by adding to existing problems.

economic and military powers over vast regions of the 
Mughal Empire. As the governors consolidated their 
control over the provinces, the periodic remission of 
revenue to the capital declined.
Peasant and zamindari rebellions in many parts of 
northern and western India added to these problems. 
These revolts were sometimes caused by the pressures 
of mounting taxes. At other times they were attempts 
by powerful chieftains to consolidate their own 
positions. Mughal authority had been challenged by 
rebellious groups in the past as well. But these groups 
were now able to seize the economic resources of the

The ageing emperor had to accept this demand. He wrote 
letters to all the chiefs and rulers of the country to come 
forward and organise a confederacy of Indian states to fight 
the British. This single step taken by Bahadur Shah had 
great implications.
The Mughal dynasty had ruled over a very large 
part of the country. Most smaller rulers and chieftains 
controlled different territories on behalf of the Mughal 
ruler.  Threatened by the expansion of British rule, many 
of them felt that if the Mughal emperor could rule again, 
they too would be able to rule their own territories once 
more, under Mughal authority.  
The British had not expected this to happen. They thought 
the disturbance caused by the issue of the cartridges would die 
down. But Bahadur Shah Zafar’s decision to bless the uprising

society and tribal people constantly interacted with each 
other. This interaction caused both kinds of societies 
to adapt and change. There were many different tribes 
and they took up diverse livelihoods. Over a period of

Others, however, rejected both the caste system and

How did Tribal Groups Live?
By the nineteenth century, tribal people in different parts 
of India were involved in a variety of activities. 
Some were jhum cultivators
Some of them practised jhum cultivation, that is, shifting 
cultivation. This was done on small patches of land, mostly 
in forests. The cultivators cut the treetops to allow sunlight 
to reach the ground, and burnt the vegetation on the land 
to clear it for cultivation. They spread the ash from the 
firing, which contained potash, to fertilise the soil. They 
used the axe to cut trees and the hoe to scratch the soil 
in order to prepare it for cultivation. They broadcast the 
seeds, that is, scattered the seeds on the field instead of 
ploughing the land  and sowing the seeds. Once the crop 
was ready and harvested, they moved to another field. 
A field that had been cultivated once was left fallow for 
several years,

There are many definitions for this social entity. Today, 
anthropologists usually consider a tribe to be a group of 
families or clans sharing a tradition of common descent, a 
culture and a language, living as a close-knit community 
under a chief and holding no private property.
Interestingly, ancient India did not have a word for ‘tribe’ 
— tribes were just different janas that lived in a specific 
environment, such as forests or mountains. The Constitution 
of India uses the terms ‘tribes’ and ‘tribal communities’ in 
English, and janjāti in Hindi.
According to official figures, in 2011 India had 705 tribes 
spread over most States, amounting to a population of about 
104 million people — more than the populations of Australia 
and the United Kingdom together!
In the 19 th century, anthropologists studying tribes often 
described them as ‘primitive’ or ‘inferior’ to civilised people.

other hand, many dominant tribes of Punjab, Sind and 
the North-West Frontier had adopted Islam quite early. 
They continued to reject the caste system. The unequal 
social order, prescribed by orthodox Hinduism, was 
not widely accepted in these areas. 
The emergence of states is closely related to social 
change amongst tribal people. Two examples of this 
important part of our history are described below.
A Closer Look
The Gonds
The Gonds lived in a vast forested region called 
Gondwana – or “country inhabited by Gonds”. They 
practised shifting cultivation. The large Gond tribe 
was further divided into many smaller clans. Each clan 
had its own raja or 
. About the time that the power 
of the Delhi Sultans was declining, a few large Gond 
kingdoms were beginning to dominate the smaller 
Gond chiefs. The , a history of Akbar’s 
reign, mentions the Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga 
that had 70,000 villages.

How did potatoes affect European populations?,"According to the context, potatoes affected European populations by allowing Europe's poor to eat better and live longer. This was particularly significant in Ireland, where the poorest peasants became heavily dependent on potatoes. When a disease destroyed the potato crop in the mid-1840s, hundreds of thousands of people died of starvation.","The introduction of the potato allowed Europe's poor to eat better and live longer. However, Ireland's poorest peasants became so dependent on potatoes that when disease destroyed the crop in the mid-1840s, hundreds of thousands died of starvation.

The  Making  of  a  Global  World
(Here we will use ‘America’ to describe Nor th America, South
America and the Caribbean.) In fact, many of our common foods
came from America’s original inhabitants – the American Indians.
Sometimes the new crops could make the difference between life
and death. Europe’s poor began to eat better and live longer with
the introduction of the humble potato. Ireland’s poorest peasants
became so dependent on potatoes that when disease destroyed the
potato crop in the mid-1840s, hundreds of thousands died
of starvation.
1.3 Conquest, Disease and Trade
The pre-modern world shrank greatly in the sixteenth century after
European sailors found a sea route to Asia and also successfully
crossed the western ocean to America. For centuries before, the
Indian Ocean had known a bustling trade, with goods, people,
knowledge, customs, etc . criss-cr ossing its w aters. 
The Indian
subcontinent was central to these flows and a crucial point in their","search of El Dorado, the fabled city of gold.
The Portuguese and Spanish conquest and colonisation of America
was decisively under way by the mid-sixteenth century.  European
conquest was not just a result of  superior firepower. In fact, the
most powerful weapon of the Spanish conquerors was not a
conventional military weapon at all. It was the germs such as those
of smallpox that they carried on their person. Because of their long
isolation, America’s original inhabitants had no immunity against
these diseases that came from Europe. Smallpox in particular proved
a deadly killer. Once introduced, it spread deep into the continent,
ahead even of any Europeans reaching there. It killed and decimated
whole communities, paving the way for conquest.

are people who do not live in one place but move from one area to
another to earn their living. In many parts of India we can see nomadic
pastoralists on the move with their herds of goats and sheep, or
camels and cattle. Have you ever wondered where they are coming
from and where they are headed? Do you know how they live and
earn? What their past has been?
Pastoralists rarely enter the pages of history textbooks. When you
read about the economy – whether in your classes of history or

you read about artisans; but rarely about pastoralists. As if their
lives do not matter. As if they are figures from the past who have no

forage was available, the grass was succulent and the undergrowth
in the forest was ample. They had to move because the Forest
Department permits that had been issued to them now ruled their
lives. The permit specified the periods in which  they could be
legally within a forest. If they overstayed they were liable to fines.
Third, British officials were suspicious of nomadic people. They
distrusted mobile craftsmen and traders who hawked their goods
in villages, and pastoralists who changed their places of residence
every season, moving in search of good pastures for their herds.

animals and gathering forest produce. They saw forests 
as essential for survival. The Khonds were such a

was not the cold and the snow that defined the seasonal rhythms of

How did new castes emerge in Indian society?,"According to the context, new castes emerged in Indian society as people with new skills were required due to economic and societal growth. Smaller castes or jatis emerged within the Brahmana community itself, and specialized artisans like smiths, carpenters, and masons were recognized as separate jatis by the Brahmanas.","As the economy and the needs of society grew, people with new skills were required, leading to the emergence of smaller castes, or *jatis*, within *varnas*. Additionally, many tribes and social groups were integrated into caste-based society and given the status of *jatis*. Specialised artisans were also recognised as separate *jatis* by the Brahmanas.

because different kinds of societies evolved 
differently. It is important to understand 
how and why this happened.
In large parts of the subcontinent, society 
was already divided according to the rules 
of . These rules, as prescribed by the 
Brahmanas, were accepted by the rulers 
of large kingdoms. The difference between 
the high and low, and between the rich and 
poor, increased. Under the Delhi Sultans 
and the Mughals, this hierarchy between 
social classes grew further. 
Beyond Big Cities: Tribal 
Societies 
There were, however, other kinds of 
societies as well. Many societies in the 
subcontinent did not follow the social rules 
and rituals prescribed by the Brahmanas.","54
Many pastoral tribes reared and sold animals, 
such as cattle and horses, to the prosperous people. 
Different castes of petty pedlars 
also travelled from village to 
village. They made and 
sold wares such as ropes, 
reeds, straw matting and 
coarse sacks. Sometimes 
mendicants acted as 
wandering merchants. There 
were castes of entertainers who performed in different 
towns and villages for their livelihood.

Hierarchies
As the economy and the needs of society grew, people 
with new skills were required. Smaller castes, or

in an effort to get rid of the hold of caste prejudice in 
their lives. 
There were also others who questioned the injustices

Members of each tribe were united by kinship 
bonds. Many tribes obtained their livelihood from 
agriculture. Others were hunter-gatherers or herders. 
Most often they combined these activities to make 
full use of the natural resources of the area in which 
they lived. Some tribes were nomadic and moved 
from one place to another. A tribal group controlled 
land and pastures jointly, and divided these amongst 
households according to its own rules. 
Many large tribes thrived in different parts of the 
subcontinent. They usually lived in forests, hills, 
clashed with the more powerful caste-based societies. 
In various ways, the tribes retained their freedom and 
preserved their separate culture. 
But the caste-based and tribal societies also 
depended on each other for their diverse needs. This 
caused both societies to change.

that were very different from those laid 
down by Brahmans. These societies also 
did not have the sharp social divisions 
that were characteristic of caste societies. 
All those who belonged to the same tribe  
thought of themselves as sharing common 
ties of kinship. However, this did not mean 
that there were no social and economic 
differences within tribes.

How did Tribal Groups Live?
By the nineteenth century, tribal people in different parts 
of India were involved in a variety of activities. 
Some were jhum cultivators
Some of them practised jhum cultivation, that is, shifting 
cultivation. This was done on small patches of land, mostly 
in forests. The cultivators cut the treetops to allow sunlight 
to reach the ground, and burnt the vegetation on the land 
to clear it for cultivation. They spread the ash from the 
firing, which contained potash, to fertilise the soil. They 
used the axe to cut trees and the hoe to scratch the soil 
in order to prepare it for cultivation. They broadcast the 
seeds, that is, scattered the seeds on the field instead of 
ploughing the land  and sowing the seeds. Once the crop 
was ready and harvested, they moved to another field. 
A field that had been cultivated once was left fallow for 
several years,

* Tribal societies had rich oral traditions, and these were passed down to each new generation.
* As tribal states became bigger and stronger, they gave land grants to labourers and nomads (question 2d).

The accounts of many travellers tell us about the life of pastoral
groups. In the early nineteenth century , Buchanan visited the
Gollas during his travel through Mysore. He wrote:
‘Their families live in small villages near the skirt of the woods,
where they cultivate a little ground, and keep some of their
cattle, selling in the towns the produce of the dairy.
Their families are very numerous, seven to eight young men in
each being common. Two or three of these attend the flocks in

Second: it prevented Company weavers from dealing with other

Once an order was placed, the weavers were given loans to purchase
the raw material for their production. Those who took loans had to
hand over the cloth they produced to the gomastha. They could not
take it to any other trader.
As loans flowed in and the demand for fine textiles expanded,
weavers eagerly took the advances, hoping to earn more. Many
weavers had small plots of land which they had earlier cultivated
along with weaving, and the produce from this took care of their
family needs. Now they had to lease out the land and devote all their
time to weaving. Weaving, in fact, required the labour of the entire
family, with children and women all engaged in different stages of
the process.
Soon, however, in many weaving villages there were reports of"

Sometimes the new crops could make the difference between life

2.4 Rinderpest, or the Cattle Plague
In Africa, in the 1890s, a fast-spreading disease of cattle plague
or Rinderpest had a terrifying impact on people’s
livelihoods and the local economy. This is a good example
of the widespread European imperial impact on colonised
societies. It shows how in this era of conquest even a disease
affecting cattle reshaped the lives and fortunes of thousands
of people and their relations with the rest of the world.
Historically, Africa had abundant land and a relatively small
population. For centuries, land and livestock sustained African
livelihoods and people rarely worked for a wage. In late-
nineteenth-century Africa there were few consumer goods that
wages could buy. If you had been an African possessing land
and livestock – and there was plenty of both – you too would
have seen little reason to work for a wage.
In the late nineteenth century, Europeans were attracted to","search of El Dorado, the fabled city of gold.
The Portuguese and Spanish conquest and colonisation of America
was decisively under way by the mid-sixteenth century.  European
conquest was not just a result of  superior firepower. In fact, the
most powerful weapon of the Spanish conquerors was not a
conventional military weapon at all. It was the germs such as those
of smallpox that they carried on their person. Because of their long
isolation, America’s original inhabitants had no immunity against
these diseases that came from Europe. Smallpox in particular proved
a deadly killer. Once introduced, it spread deep into the continent,
ahead even of any Europeans reaching there. It killed and decimated
whole communities, paving the way for conquest.

8  New Forms of Publication
Printing created an appetite for new kinds of writing. As more and
more people could now read, they wanted to see their own lives,
experiences, emotions and relationships reflected in what they read.
The novel, a literary firm which had developed in Europe, ideally
catered to this need. It soon acquired distinctively Indian forms and
styles. For readers

gave a vivid sense of the diversity of human lives.
Other new literary forms also enter ed the w orld of  r eading –

and intimate feelings, about the political and social rules that shaped
such things.

other hand, many dominant tribes of Punjab, Sind and 
the North-West Frontier had adopted Islam quite early. 
They continued to reject the caste system. The unequal 
social order, prescribed by orthodox Hinduism, was 
not widely accepted in these areas. 
The emergence of states is closely related to social 
change amongst tribal people. Two examples of this 
important part of our history are described below.
A Closer Look
The Gonds
The Gonds lived in a vast forested region called 
Gondwana – or “country inhabited by Gonds”. They 
practised shifting cultivation. The large Gond tribe 
was further divided into many smaller clans. Each clan 
had its own raja or 
. About the time that the power 
of the Delhi Sultans was declining, a few large Gond 
kingdoms were beginning to dominate the smaller 
Gond chiefs. The , a history of Akbar’s 
reign, mentions the Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga 
that had 70,000 villages. 
The administrative system of these kingdoms was","devoted to Shiva) and Alvars (saints devoted to Vishnu) 
who came from all castes including those considered 
“untouchable” like the Pulaiyar and the Panars. They 
were sharply critical of the Buddhists and Jainas 
and preached ardent love of Shiva or Vishnu as the 
path to salvation. They drew upon the ideals of love 
and heroism as found in the Sangam literature (the 
earliest example of Tamil literature, composed during 
the early centuries of the Common Era) and blended 
them with the values of bhakti. The Nayanars and 
Alvars went from place to place composing exquisite 
poems in praise of the deities enshrined in the villages 
they visited, and set them to music.

The first term, ‘Bhāratavarṣha’, clearly extends to the entire

","WOMEN, CASTE AND REFORM         79
Differences between men and women were not the 
only ones in society. In most regions, people were divided 
along lines of caste. Brahmans and Kshatriyas considered 
themselves as “upper castes”. Others, such as traders 
and moneylenders (often referred to as Vaishyas) were 
placed after them. Then came peasants, and artisans 
such as weavers and potters (referred to as Shudras). 
At the lowest rung were those who laboured to keep 
cities and villages clean or worked at jobs that upper 
castes considered “polluting”, that is, it could lead to 
the loss of caste status. The upper castes also treated 
many of these groups at the bottom as “untouchable”. 
They were not allowed to enter temples, draw water 
from the wells used by the upper castes, or bathe in 
ponds where upper castes bathed. They were seen as 
inferior human beings.

As this example shows, Phule extended his criticism 
of the caste system to argue against all forms of 
inequality. He was concerned about the plight of 
“upper”-caste women, the miseries of the labourer, and 
the humiliation of the “low” castes. This movement for 
caste reform was continued in the twentieth century

Law against child marriage  
With the growth of women’s organisations 
and writings on these issues, the 
momentum for reform gained strength. 
People challenged another established 
custom –  that of child marriage. There 
were a number of Indian legislators in the 
Central Legislative Assembly who fought 
to make a law preventing child marriage. 
In 1929, the Child Marriage Restraint Act 
was passed without the kind of bitter 
debates and struggles that earlier laws 
had seen. According to the Act, no man 
below the age of 18 and woman below 
the age of 16 could marry. Subsequently 
these limits were raised to 21 for men and 
18 for women.

How did Bhakti allow people from different backgrounds to worship?,"According to the context, Bhakti allowed people from different backgrounds to worship by introducing a personal, loving deity that devotees could reach without the aid of priests or elaborate rituals.

DEVOTIONAL PATHS 
TO THE DIVINE
The beginning of 
Bhakti
Worship of certain 
deities, which 
became a central 
feature of later 
Hinduism, gained in 
importance. These 
deities included 
Shiva, Vishnu, and 
goddesses such as 
Durga. These deities 
were worshipped 
through Bhakti, an 
idea that became 
very popular at 
this time. Bhakti is 
generally understood 
as a person’s 
devotion to his or 
her chosen deity.","One of the major developments of this period was the 
emergence of the idea of bhakti – of a loving, personal 
deity that devotees could reach without the aid of 
priests or elaborate rituals. You will be learning about 
this, and other traditions, in Chapter 6.

The  Making  of  a  Global  World
(Here we will use ‘America’ to describe Nor th America, South
America and the Caribbean.) In fact, many of our common foods
came from America’s original inhabitants – the American Indians.
Sometimes the new crops could make the difference between life
and death. Europe’s poor began to eat better and live longer with
the introduction of the humble potato. Ireland’s poorest peasants
became so dependent on potatoes that when disease destroyed the
potato crop in the mid-1840s, hundreds of thousands died
of starvation.
1.3 Conquest, Disease and Trade
The pre-modern world shrank greatly in the sixteenth century after
European sailors found a sea route to Asia and also successfully
crossed the western ocean to America. For centuries before, the
Indian Ocean had known a bustling trade, with goods, people,
knowledge, customs, etc . criss-cr ossing its w aters.

ActivityThus by 1890, a global agricultural economy had taken shape,
accompanied by complex changes in labour movement patterns,
capital flows, ecologies and technology. Food no longer came from
a nearby village or town, but from thousands of miles away

not grown by a peasant tilling his own land, but by an agricultural
worker, perhaps recently arrived, who was now working on a large
farm that only a generation ago had most likely been a forest. It was
transported by railway, built for that very purpose, and by ships
which were increasingly manned in these decades by low-paid
workers from southern Europe, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.

How did slavery support European economies?,"According to the context, slavery supported European economies by:

* Meeting the growing demand for sugar, coffee, and indigo in European markets through the exploitation of slave labor in the Caribbean.
* Enabling port cities like Bordeaux and Nantes to prosper economically due to the flourishing slave trade.

These points suggest that slavery was a key factor in sustaining European economic growth and prosperity during this period.","Slavery supported European economies by providing cheap labor for the production of goods like sugar, coffee, and indigo, which were in high demand in European markets. Port cities like Bordeaux and Nantes prospered due to the slave trade.

There they were sold to plantation owners. The exploitation of slave
labour made it possible to meet the growing demand in European
markets for sugar, coffee, and indigo. Port cities like Bordeaux and
Nantes owed their economic prosperity to the flourishing slave trade.
Throughout the eighteenth century there was little criticism of slavery
in France. The National Assembly held long debates about whether
the rights of man should be extended to all French subjects including
those in the colonies. But it did not pass any laws, fearing opposition
from businessmen whose incomes depended on the slave trade. It
was finally the Convention which in 1794 legislated to free all slaves
in the French overseas possessions. This, however, turned out to be
a short-term measure: ten years later, Napoleon reintroduced slavery.","T h e    F r e n c h    R e v o l u t i o n

One of the most revolutionary social reforms of the Jacobin regime
was the abolition of slavery in the French colonies. The colonies in
the Caribbean – Martinique, Guadeloupe and San Domingo – were
important suppliers of commodities such as tobacco, indigo, sugar
and coffee. But the reluctance of Europeans to go and work in distant
and unfamiliar lands meant a shortage of labour on the plantations.
So this was met by a triangular slave trade between Europe, Africa
and the Americas. The slave trade began in the seventeenth century.
French merchants sailed from the ports of Bordeaux or Nantes to
the African coast, where they bought slaves from local chieftains.

a more varied diet. To the earlier monotony of bread and potatoes
many, though not all, could now add meat (and butter and eggs)
to their diet. Better living conditions promoted social peace within

2.3 Late nineteenth-century Colonialism
Trade flourished and markets expanded in the late nineteenth
century. But this was not only a period of expanding trade and
increased prosperity. It is important to realise that there was a
darker side to this process.  In many parts of the world, the
expansion of trade and a closer relationship with the world
economy also meant a loss of freedoms and livelihoods. Late-
nineteenth-century European conquests produced many painful
economic, social and ecological changes through which the
colonised societies were brought into the world economy.

deities, which

Hinduism, gained in 
importance. These 
deities included 
Shiva, Vishnu, and 
goddesses such as

What were the Corn Laws?,"According to the context, the Corn Laws were laws allowing the government to restrict the import of corn. These laws were abolished due to unhappiness with high food prices among industrialists and urban dwellers.

2.1 A World Economy Takes Shape
A good place to start is the changing pattern of food production
and consumption in industrial Europe. Traditionally, countries liked
to be self-sufficient in food. But in nineteenth-century Britain,
self-sufficiency in food meant lower living standards and social
conflict. Why was this so?

under cultivation. From the mid-nineteenth century, Waste Land
Rules were enacted in various parts of the country. By these Rules
uncultivated lands were taken over and given to select individuals.
These individuals were granted various concessions and encouraged
to settle these lands. Some of them were made headmen of villages
in the newly cleared areas. In most areas the lands taken over
were actually grazing tracts used regularly by pastoralists. So
expansion of cultivation inevitably meant the decline of pastures
and a problem for pastoralists.
Second, by the mid-nineteenth century, various Forest Acts were
also being enacted in the different provinces.  Through these Acts
some forests which produced commercially valuable timber like
deodar or sal were declared ‘Reserved’. No pastoralist was allowed
access to these forests. Other forests were classified as ‘Protected’."

The Idea of a Supreme God
Before large kingdoms emerged, different groups                
of people worshipped their own gods and goddesses. 
As people were brought together through the growth 
of towns, trade and empires, new ideas began to 
develop. The idea that all living things pass through 
countless cycles of birth and rebirth performing good 
deeds and bad came to be widely accepted. Similarly, 
the idea that all human beings are not equal even at 
birth gained ground during this period. The belief that 
social privileges came from birth in a “noble” family or 
a “high” caste was the subject of many learned texts.
Many people were uneasy with such ideas and","and 
customs. They were therefore, more than willing to 
listen to Rammohun who was reputed to be a learned man. 
In	1829,	sati	was	banned.	
The strategy adopted by 
Rammohun was used by 
later reformers as well. Whenever they wished to 
challenge a practice that seemed harmful, they tried 
to find a verse or sentence in the ancient sacred texts 
that supported their point of view. They then suggested 
that the practice as it existed at present was against 
early tradition.

How did these groups influence Bhakti traditions?,"According to the context, these groups influenced Bhakti traditions by:

* Rejecting ritualism and outward displays of piety
* Rejection of social differences based on birth
* Emphasis on personal devotion (bhakti) to a Supreme God
* Advocating for humanist ideas such as humility, service, and earning one's livelihood like any other person.

These groups' influence led to the emergence of Bhakti traditions that focused on personal devotion to a chosen deity.","The provided context highlights the influence of saint-poets who rejected ritualism, outward displays of piety, and social differences based on birth, advocating for a personal god residing in the hearts of all people. Their teachings emphasized living with families, earning livelihoods, and serving fellow human beings. It also mentions the influence of the Buddha and Jainas' teachings.
","One of the major developments of this period was the 
emergence of the idea of bhakti – of a loving, personal 
deity that devotees could reach without the aid of 
priests or elaborate rituals. You will be learning about 
this, and other traditions, in Chapter 6.

These saint-poets rejected all forms of ritualism, 
outward display of piety and social differences 
based on birth. In fact, they even rejected the idea of 
renunciation and preferred to live with their families,

Many people were uneasy with such ideas and 
turned to the teachings of the Buddha or the Jainas 
according to which it was possible to overcome social 
differences and break the cycle of rebirth through 
personal effort. Others felt attracted to the idea of a 
Supreme God who could deliver humans from such

The Mughals were descendants

From their mother’s side they were

Asia. From their father’s side, they 
were the successors of Timur (died 
1404), the ruler of Iran, Iraq and  
modern-day Turkey. However, 
the Mughals did not like to be 
called Mughal or Mongol. This was 
because Genghis Khan’s memory 
was associated with the massacre 
of innumerable people. It was also 
linked with the Uzbegs, their Mongol 
competitors. On the other hand, the 
Mughals were proud of their Timurid

How are people commonly described in terms of their identity?,"According to the context, people are commonly described in terms of their identity by personifying a nation as a female figure. This is done to give a concrete form to the abstract idea of the nation, making it easier for people to identify with and relate to.","People are commonly described in terms of their identity through symbols and allegories that represent abstract ideas like Liberty, Justice, or the nation itself. These symbols can include objects (red cap, broken chain, scales), colors (tricolour), or figures (Marianne, Germania) with specific characteristics (oak leaves for heroism).
","symbols.  As you would remember, the attributes of Liberty are the
red cap, or the broken chain, while Justice is generally a blindfolded
woman carrying a pair of weighing scales.
Similar female allegories were invented by artists in the nineteenth
century to represent the nation. In France she was christened
Marianne, a popular Christian name, which underlined the idea of a
people’s nation. Her characteristics were drawn from those of Liberty
and the Republic – the red cap, the tricolour, the cockade. Statues
of Marianne were erected in public squares to remind the public of
the national symbol of unity and to persuade them to identify with
it. Marianne images were marked on coins and stamps.
Similarly, Germania became the allegory of the German nation. In
visual representations, Germania wears a crown of oak leaves, as
the German oak stands for heroism.

5  Visualising the Nation
While it is easy enough to represent a ruler through a portrait or a
statue, how does one go about giving a face to a nation? Artists in
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries found a way out by
personifying a nation. In other words they represented a country as
if  it were a person. Nations were then portrayed as female figures.
The female form that was chosen to per
sonify the nation did not
stand for any particular woman in real life; rather it sought to give
the abstract idea of the nation a concrete form. That is, the female
figure became an allegory of the nation.
You will recall that during the French Revolution artists used the
female allegory to portray ideas such as Liberty, Justice and the
Republic. These ideals were represented through specific objects or
symbols.  As you would remember, the attributes of Liberty are the

Let us begin by looking at an example of the

kingdom of Mahodayapuram was established in 
the ninth century in the south-western part of the 
peninsula, part of the present-day Kerala. It is likely 
that Malayalam was spoken in this area. The rulers

oneself to what is truly necessary in life.

without one another . Scientists studying nature, flora and

?
The Emergence of New Dynasties
By the seventh century, there were big landlords or 
warrior chiefs in different regions of the subcontinent. 
Existing kings often acknowledged them as their 
subordinates or  They 
were expected to bring gifts for their 
kings or overlords, be present at 
their courts and provide them with 
military support. As  gained 
power and wealth, they declared 
themselves to be 
, 
 (the great 
lord of a “circle” or region) and so 
independence from their overlords. 
One such instance was that of 
the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan. 
Initially they were subordinate to 
the Chalukyas of Karnataka. In the 
mid-eighth century, Dantidurga, a 
Rashtrakuta chief, overthrew his Chalukya overlord and 
performed a ritual called  (literally, the 
golden womb). When this ritual was performed with 
the help of Brahmanas, it was thought to lead to the

","folk, tribal and Hindu belief systems have 
many similar concepts. For instance, in all 
three, elements of nature such as mountains, 
rivers, trees, plants and animals, and some 
stones too, are regarded as sacred, because 
there is consciousness behind all of them. 
Indeed, tribes generally worship many deities 
associated with those natural elements. For the 
Toda tribals of the Nilgiris of Tamil Nadu, for 
instance (one of them is pictured in the image on the right), 
over thirty peaks of this mountain range are residences of 
a god or a goddess; those peaks are so sacred that the Todas 
avoid pointing to them with a finger . 
But despite this multiplicity of deities, as with Hinduism, 
many tribal groups have a concept of a higher divinity or 
supreme being. For example, several tribes of Arunachal 
Pradesh worship Donyipolo, a combined form of the Sun and

The vast plains of the Punjab (today 
divided between India and Pakistan) and 
Sindh (now in Pakistan) are watered by 
the Indus River and its tributaries. This 
made those plains fertile and, therefore, 
favourable to agriculture. A little further 
east, a few millenniums ago, another 
river , the Sarasvatī, used to flow from 
the foothills of the Himalayas through 
Haryana, Punjab, parts of Rajasthan 
and Gujarat (see Fig. 6.3). In this whole 
region, from about 3500 BCE, villages 
grew into towns, and with increasing 
trade and other exchanges, those towns 
further grew into cities. This transition 
happened around 2600 BCE.

The  Making  of  a  Global  World

When we talk of ‘globalisation’ we often refer to an economic
system that has emerged since the last 50 years or so. But as you will
see in this chapter, the making of the global world has a long
history – of trade, of migration, of people in search of work, the
movement of capital, and much else. As we think about the dramatic
and visible signs of global interconnectedness in our lives today,
we need to understand the phases through which this world in
which we live has emerged.
All through history, human societies have become steadily more
interlinked. From ancient times, travellers, traders, priests and
pilgrims travelled vast distances for knowledge, opportunity and
spiritual fulfilment, or to escape persecution. They carried goods,
money

The anthropologist K.S. Singh directed 
the ‘People of India’ project we referred 
to earlier (see page 126). In the case of 
the Mahābhārata, he observed, “There 
is hardly a place in the country which 
the epic heroes such as the Pandavas, did not visit according 
to folklores.” And the same may be said of the Rāmāyaṇa. 
Over the centuries, perhaps more than any other texts, 
these two epics created a dense web of cultural interactions 
across India and many parts of Asia. Another example of 
unity in diversity.
To further illustrate the theme of this chapter , we could 
have continued our journey and turned to more facets 
of Indian culture. For instance, in India’s classical arts, 
including classical architecture, both diversity and unity 
are easily noticeable. (You will study these fields through 
the Art Curricular Area.)  
In the end, we should remember that Indian culture

Introduction – Why Social Science?
clear . The past is a major source for our identities — it 
helps us understand who we are and where we come from. 
The past is still with us, in other words. And since history is 
unfortunately not all about happy developments, it is useful 
to understand where people, governments or rulers went 
wrong, and why. Only then can we hope to avoid repeating 
those errors. 
Theme C – Our Cultural Heritage and 
Knowledge Traditions
It has often been said that India has a rich and ancient 
culture. True, but what are its main characteristics? Its 
guiding principles? How has it manifested itself in India’s 
history? And how can it help us to deal with issues of our 
times? These are some of the questions that this theme is 
exploring, with the objective that every student should 
understand some of the cultural foundations of our 
civilization and learn to appreciate their value.
Theme D – Governance and Democracy","nation, Indian history had to be thought about differently. The British
saw Indians as backward and primitive, incapable of governing
themselves. In response, Indians began looking into the past to
discover India’s great achievements. They wrote about the glorious
developments in ancient times when art and architecture, science
and mathematics, religion and culture, law and philosophy, crafts
and trade had f lourished. This glorious time, in their vie w, was
followed by a history of decline, when India was colonised. These
nationalist histories urged the readers to take pride in India’s great
achievements in the past and str uggle to c hange the miser able
conditions of life under British rule.
These efforts to unify people were not without problems. When the
past being glorified was Hindu, when the images celebrated were
drawn from Hindu iconography, then people of other communities
felt left out.

Our Cultural Heritage and Knowledge Traditions
Indian culture, by any estimate, is several millenniums old. 
Like any ancient tree, it has many roots and many branches. 
The roots nurture a common trunk. And from the trunk 
emerge many branches, which are different manifestations 
of Indian culture, yet united by a common trunk.
Some of these branches are about art, literature, science, 
medicine, religion, the art of governance, martial arts, and 
so on. There are also ‘schools of thought’, by which we mean 
groups of thinkers or spiritual seekers who share similar 
ideas about human life, the world, etc.
Many archaeologists and scholars have pointed out that 
some of India’s cultural roots go all the way to the Indus 
or Harappan or Sindhu-Sarasvatī civilisation (which we

of thought emerged in India. We will see here a few early","105

Although the Vedic, Buddhist and Jain schools had important 
differences, they also shared some common concepts, 
such as dharma, karma, rebirth, the search for an end to 
suffering and ignorance, and many important values. This 
is the ‘trunk’ of the tree we started this chapter with.
Folk and Tribal Roots

in many texts.  India has also had rich ‘oral traditions’, that

practice, without written texts (this is the case of the 
Vedas). Among them are numerous folk traditions, that

Along with a year and a decade (a period of ten years), we often 
use other terms to understand longer durations of time. Two of 
these are quite commonly used when learning about history.
1. Century: It is any period of 100 years. In history, specific","Why, then, do we continue to associate history with 
a string of dates? This association has a reason. There 
was a time when history was an account of battles and big 
events. It was about rulers and their policies. Historians 
wrote about the year a king was crowned, the year he 
married, the year he had a child, the year he fought a 
particular war, the year he died, and the year the next 
ruler succeeded to the throne. For events such as these, 
specific dates can be determined, and in histories such 
as these, debates about dates continue to be important. 
As you have seen in the history textbooks of the past 
two years, historians now write about a host of other 
issues, and other questions. They look at how people 
earned their livelihood, what they produced and ate, how 
cities developed and markets came up, how kingdoms 
were formed and new ideas spread, and how cultures 
and society changed.
Which dates?
By what criteria do we choose a set of dates as","Introduction: 
How, When and Where
1
How Important are Dates?
There was a time when historians were 
fascinated with dates. There were heated 
debates about the dates on which rulers 
were crowned or battles were fought. In 
the common-sense notion, history was 
synonymous with dates. You may have 
heard people say, “I find history boring 
because it is all about memorising 
dates.” Is such a conception true?
History is certainly about changes 
that occur over time. It is about 
finding out how things were in the 
past and how things have changed. 
As soon as we compare the past with 
the present, we refer to time, we talk of 
“before” and “after”. 
Living in the world we do not always 
ask historical questions about what 
we see around us. We take things for 
granted, as if what we see has always 
been in the world we inhabit. But most of 
us have our moments of wonder, when we are 
curious, and we ask questions that actually are historical."
What are historical sources?,"According to the context, historical sources are various pieces of evidence or information that historians use to reconstruct the past. These sources include:

* Ancient inscriptions (studied by epigraphists)
* Human societies and cultures (studied by anthropologists)
* Literature and languages
* Scientific studies, such as:
	+ Studies of ancient climates
	+ Chemical studies of excavated materials
	+ Genetics of ancient people
* Newspapers (for recent history)
* Electronic media (television, internet, etc.) (for recent history)

These sources provide information that historians can use to piece together the past and re-create historical events.","Historical sources are various resources from which historians gather information to study and reconstruct the past. These sources include ancient monuments, items of trade, inscriptions, literature, languages, newspapers, and electronic media.

human societies and their cultures), experts in literature

years or so, scientific studies have been contributing more 
and more to the reconstruction of the past. For example, 
studies of ancient climates, chemical studies of excavated 
materials and studies of the genetics of ancient people have 
provided fresh insights, which supplement the more usual 
sources. And when historians study recent history (which 
usually means the last two or three centuries), another 
source is newspapers; for the last few decades, electronic 
media (television, the internet, etc.) can also be consulted.

remember them all now; we will use some of them as we go 
along. When historians study, say, a king or queen of 1,500 
years ago, an ancient monument, a war or some items of 
trade, they take great care to gather information from as 
many sources as they can find and consult. Sometimes, the 
sources confirm each other (the jigsaw pieces match); at 
other times, sources may give contradictory information 
(the jigsaw pieces don’t match), in which case they need to 
decide which source they can trust more. That is how they 
try to re-create the history of the period they are studying.
Who contributes to all these sources of history? Historians

Democracy
You may have noticed that we earlier mentioned 
‘representatives of the people’. This is one of the foundation 
stones of the system of governance adopted by most countries 
of the world — democracy. The word ‘democracy’ comes 
from two Greek words — dēmos meaning ‘people’, and 
kratos meaning ‘rule’ or ‘power’; so ‘democracy’ literally 
means the ‘rule of the people’. 
But can all people actually rule? It is clearly not possible.

something wrong with the classroom, or with the school’s

The National Assembly completed the draft of the constitution in

powers instead of being concentrated in the hands of one person,
were now separated and assigned to different institutions – the
legislature, executive and judiciary. This made France a constitutional
monarchy. Fig. 7 explains how the new political system worked.
The Constitution of 1791 vested the power to make laws in the
National Assembly, which was indirectly elected. That is, citizens
voted for a group of electors, who in turn chose the Assembly. Not
all citizens, however, had the right to vote. Only men above 25 years

These preserved the memories of heroes and were 
expected to inspire others to follow their example. 
Ordinary people were also attracted by these stories 
– which often depicted dramatic situations, and a 
range of strong emotions – loyalty, friendship, love, 
valour, anger, etc. 
Did women find a place within these stories? 
Sometimes women are depicted as following their 
heroic husbands in both life and death – there are 
stories about the practice of 
or the immolation 
of widows on the funeral pyre of their husbands. So 
those who followed the heroic ideal often had to pay 
for it with their lives.

manner, whether willingly or otherwise, were called “sati”, 
meaning virtuous women. Women’s rights to property were 
also restricted. Besides, most women had virtually no access 
to education. In many parts of the country people believed 
that if a woman was educated, she would become a widow.

 “We first tie them down to the pile” 
Rammohun Roy published many pamphlets to spread his 
ideas. Some of these were written as a dialogue between the 
advocate and critic of a traditional practice. Here is one such 
dialogue on sati: 
ADVOCATE OF SATI:
Women are by nature of inferior understanding, 
without resolution, unworthy of trust … Many of them, 
on the death of their husbands, become desirous of 
accompanying them; but to remove every chance of 
their trying to escape from the blazing fire, in burning 
them we first tie them down to the pile. 
OPPONENT OF SATI: 
When did you ever afford them a fair opportunity 
of exhibiting their natural capacity? How then can 
you accuse them of want of understanding? If, after 
instruction in knowledge and wisdom, a person cannot 
comprehend or retain what has been taught him, we 
may consider him as deficient; but if you do not educate 
women how can you see them as inferior.

companions like Allama Prabhu and Akkamahadevi.

How did railways help global trade?,"According to the context, railways helped global trade by:

* Creating a new demand for wood as fuel and sleepers (tracks) which led to the massive export of timber from India
* Being essential for colonial trade and the movement of imperial troops, thereby facilitating the exchange of goods and people across vast distances.","Railways helped global trade by facilitating the faster and cheaper movement of goods, including agricultural products and minerals, from distant farms to final markets.

products’ – that is, agricultural products such as wheat and cotton,
and minerals such as coal.
2.2 Role of Technology
What was the role of technology in all this? The railways, steamships,
the telegraph, for example, were important inventions without
which we cannot imagine the transformed nineteenth-century world.
But technological advances were often the result of larger social,
political and economic factors. For example, colonisation stimulated
new investments and improvements in transport: faster railways,
lighter wagons and larger ships helped move food more cheaply
and quickly from faraway farms to f
inal markets.

By the early nineteenth century, oak forests in England were
disappearing. This created a problem of timber supply for the Royal
Navy. How could English ships be built without a regular supply of
strong and durable timber? How could imperial power be protected
and maintained without ships?  By the 1820s, search parties were
sent to explore the forest resources of India.  Within a decade, trees
were being felled on a massive scale and vast quantities of timber
were being exported from India.
The spread of railways from the 1850s created a new demand.
Railways were essential for colonial trade and for the movement of
imperial troops. To run locomotives, wood was needed as fuel, and
to lay railway lines sleepers were essential to hold the tracks together.
Each mile of railway track required between 1,760 and 2,000 sleepers.
From the 1860s, the railway network expanded rapidly. By 1890,
about 25,500 km of track had been laid. In 1946, the length of the"

popular text to be painted here was Bhanudatta’s

of Delhi in 1739 resulted in the migration of Mughal 
artists to the hills to escape the uncertainties of the 
plains. Here they found ready patrons which led to 
the founding of the Kangra school of painting. By the

What was the role of refrigerated ships?,"The role of refrigerated ships was to enable the transport of perishable foods over long distances.

This allowed animals to be slaughtered in America, Australia, or New Zealand and transported to Europe as frozen meat, reducing shipping costs and lowering meat prices in Europe.
","India and the Contemporary World

The trade in meat offers a good example of this connected process.
Till the 1870s, animals were shipped live from America to Europe
and then slaughtered when they arrived there. But live animals took
up a lot of ship space. Many also died in voyage, fell ill, lost weight,
or became unfit to eat. Meat was hence an expensive luxury beyond
the reach of the European poor. High prices in turn kept demand
and production down until the development of a new technology,
namely, refrigerated ships, which enabled the transport of perishable
foods over long distances.
Now animals were slaughtered for food at the starting point – in
America, Australia or New Zealand – and then transported to
Europe as frozen meat. This reduced shipping costs and lowered
meat prices in Europe. The poor in Europe could now consume
a more varied diet. To the earlier monotony of bread and potatoes
many, though not all, could now add meat (and butter and eggs)","at which these goods could be purchased, and this 
reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way 
the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating 
rival competitors. The urge to secure markets, therefore, 
led to fierce battles between the trading companies. 
Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they 
regularly sank each other’s ships, blockaded routes, 
and prevented rival ships from moving with supplies of

The  Making  of  a  Global  World
The world changed profoundly in the nineteenth century. Economic,
political, social, cultural and technological factors interacted in
complex ways to transform societies and reshape external relations.
Economists identify three types of movement or ‘flows’ within
international economic exchanges. 
The first is the flow of trade which
in the nineteenth century referred largely to trade in goods (e.g.,
cloth or wheat). The second is the flow of labour – the migration
of people in search of employment. The third is the movement of
capital for short-term or long-term investments over long distances.
All three flows were closely interwoven and affected peoples’ lives
more deeply now than ever before. The interconnections could
sometimes be broken – for example, labour migration was often
more restricted than goods or capital flows. Yet it helps us understand
the nineteenth-century world economy better if we look at the
three flows together.","59

Prepare a flow chart to show how Britain’s

not grown by a peasant tilling his own land, but by an agricultural
worker, perhaps recently arrived, who was now working on a large
farm that only a generation ago had most likely been a forest. It was
transported by railway, built for that very purpose, and by ships
which were increasingly manned in these decades by low-paid
workers from southern Europe, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.

These decades also saw the worldwide spread of technology and
enterprise. Developing countries were in a hurry to catch up with
the advanced industrial countries. Therefore, they invested vast
amounts of capital, importing industrial plant and equipment
featuring modern technology.
4.3 Decolonisation and Independence
When the Second World War ended, large parts of the world were
still under European colonial rule. Over the next two decades most
colonies in Asia and Africa emerged as free, independent nations.
They were, however, overburdened by poverty and a lack of
resources, and their economies and societies were handicapped by
long periods of colonial rule.
The IMF and the World Bank were designed to meet the financial
needs of the industrial countries. They were not equipped to cope
with the challenge of poverty and lack of development in the former
colonies. But as Europe and Japan rapidly rebuilt their economies,"
How did industrial growth affect world trade?,"According to the context, industrial growth affected world trade by leading to specialization in the production of commodities. Between 1820 and 1914, world trade is estimated to have multiplied 25 to 40 times, with nearly 60% of this trade comprising ""primary products"" such as agricultural goods and minerals.","Industrial growth spurred specialization in commodity production and dramatically increased world trade.

2.2 Role of Technology
What was the role of technology in all this? The railways, steamships,
the telegraph, for example, were important inventions without
which we cannot imagine the transformed nineteenth-century world.
But technological advances were often the result of larger social,
political and economic factors. For example, colonisation stimulated
new investments and improvements in transport: faster railways,
lighter wagons and larger ships helped move food more cheaply
and quickly from faraway farms to f
inal markets.

1.2 The Pace of Industrial Change
How rapid was the process of industrialisation? Does industrialisation
mean only the growth of factory industries?
First: The most dynamic industries in Britain were clearly cotton and
metals. Growing at a rapid pace, cotton was the leading sector in the
first phase of industrialisation up to the 1840s. After that the iron
and steel industry led the way.
 With the expansion of railways, in
England from the 1840s and in the colonies from the 1860s, the
demand for iron and steel increased rapidly. By 1873 Britain was
exporting iron and steel worth about £ 77 million, double the value
of its cotton export.

industrial production for an international market. This was not based

powers were doing at that time. Murshid Quli Khan

ruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions, 
demanded large tributes for the Company’s right to 
trade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it 
from extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company 
of deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving

6 ― The Beginnings of Indian Civilisation
This intense agricultural activity was managed by hun-
dreds of small rural sites or villages. Then as now, the cities 
could survive only if enough agricultural produce from 
rural areas reached them on a daily basis.
The Harappans also domesticated a number of animals for 
meat consumption and fished both in rivers and in the sea. 
This is known from the large numbers of animal and fish 
bones found during excavations. 
What did Harappan cooking pots contain? Scientific 
examinations of clay pots have provided some answers, 
both expected ones (dairy products) and surprising ones — 
such as remains of turmeric, ginger and banana. Clearly,

China grew rapidly from the 1820s to become for a while India’s
single largest export. Britain grew opium in India and exported it to
China and, with the money earned through this sale, it financed its
tea and other imports from China.
Over the nineteenth century, British manufactures flooded the Indian
market. Food grain and raw material exports from India to Britain
and the rest of the world increased. But the value of British exports
to India was much higher than the value of British imports from
India. Thus Britain had a ‘trade surplus’ with India. Britain used this
surplus to balance its trade deficits with other countries – that is,
with countries from which Britain was importing more than it was

Beyond Regional Frontiers:               
The Story of Kathak 
If heroic traditions can be found in different regions in 
different forms, the same is true of dance. Let us look at 
the history of one dance form, Kathak
now associated 
with several parts of north India. The term  
is derived from , a word used in Sanskrit and 
other languages for story. The  were originally 
a caste of story-tellers in temples of north India, who 
embellished their performances with gestures and 
songs. Kathak began evolving into a distinct mode of 
the spread of the bhakti movement. The legends of 
Radha-Krishna were enacted in folk plays called r
, which combined folk dance with the basic gestures 
of the  story-tellers.
Under the Mughal emperors and their nobles, Kathak 
was performed in the court, where it acquired its present 
features and developed into a form of dance with a 
distinctive style. Subsequently, it developed in two","growth and progress.
Many historians therefore refer to this period as ‘colonial’. 
What is colonial? 
In this book, you will read about the way the British came 
to conquer the country and establish their rule, subjugating 
local nawabs and rajas. You will see how they established 
control over the economy and society, collected revenue to 
meet all their expenses, bought the goods they wanted at low 
prices, produced crops they needed for export, and you will 
understand the changes that came about as a consequence. 
You will also come to know about the changes British rule 
brought about in values and tastes, customs and practices. 
When the subjugation of one country by another leads to these 
kinds of political, economic, social and cultural changes, we 
refer to the process as colonisation. 
You will, however, find that all classes and groups did not 
experience these changes in the same way. That is why, the 
book is called Our Pasts in the plural.","Civilising the “Native”, 
Educating the Nation

In the earlier chapters, you have seen how British rule affected 
rajas and nawabs, peasants and tribals. In this chapter, we 
will try and understand what implication it had for the lives of 
students. For, the British in India wanted not only territorial 
conquest and control over revenues. They also felt that they had 
a cultural mission: they had to “civilise the natives”, change their 
customs and values.
What changes were to be introduced? How were Indians 
to be educated, “civilised”, and made into what the British 
believed were “good subjects”? The British could find no simple 
answers to these questions. They continued to be debated for 
many decades. 
How the British saw Education
Let us look at what the British thought and 
did, and how some of the ideas of education 
that we now take for granted evolved in the 
last two hundred years. In the process of this 
enquiry, we will also see how Indians reacted"

Do you know how calendars have been traditionally made in 
India? Many Indian calendars rely on the positions of the sun 
and the moon to define the months of the year . A pañchānga is 
a book of tables which lists the days of each month along with 
related astronomical data; for instance, it precisely predicts 
events like solar and lunar eclipses, times for sunrise and 
sunset, etc. Pañchāngas, still widely used in India, often also 
give weather predictions for the year , dates and timings of 
festivals, and more.

By what criteria do we choose a set of dates as 
important? The dates we select, the dates around which 
we compose our story of the past, are not important 
on their own. They become vital because we focus on 
a particular set of events as important. If our focus of 
study changes, if we begin to look at new issues, a new 
set of dates will appear significant. 
Consider an example. In the histories written by 
British historians in India, the rule of each Governor-
General was important. These histories began with the 
rule of the first Governor-General, Warren Hastings, 
and ended with the last Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten. In 
separate chapters, we read about the deeds of others  —

In this book, you will read about the way the British came 
to conquer the country and establish their rule, subjugating 
local nawabs and rajas. You will see how they established 
control over the economy and society, collected revenue to 
meet all their expenses, bought the goods they wanted at low 
prices, produced crops they needed for export, and you will 
understand the changes that came about as a consequence. 
You will also come to know about the changes British rule 
brought about in values and tastes, customs and practices. 
When the subjugation of one country by another leads to these 
kinds of political, economic, social and cultural changes, we 
refer to the process as colonisation.

experience these changes in the same way. That is why, the

Why do we need a new format to write history?,"Based on the context, we need a new format to write history because traditional methods of writing history focus only on events that fit into a narrative, excluding those that don't. For example, Indian activities are often overlooked in histories about British Governor-Generals. A new format would allow for a more inclusive and nuanced understanding of history.

The passage also suggests that we tend to associate history with precise dates because our traditional understanding of history is centered around battles, big events, and the lives of rulers. However, this approach doesn't account for changes that occur over time or processes that develop gradually.","We need a new format to write history because the old format, focused on events like the lives of British Governor-Generals, excludes the activities and perspectives of Indians.

simply do not fit, they have no space. What, then, do we 
do? Clearly, we need another format for our history. This 
would mean that the old dates will no longer have the 
significance they earlier had. A new set of dates will become 
more important for us to know.

focus. We move between a close focus on particular communities and regions to the
history of the nation; between the histories as they unfold in India and Europe to the
developments in Africa and Indonesia.  Our focus will shift according
to themes.
What are these themes and how are they organised? What is the logic behind the
choices of themes?
All too often in the past, the history of the modern world was associated with the
history of the west. It was as if change and progress happened only in the west. As if
the histories of other countries were frozen in time, they were motionless and static.
People in the west were seen as enterprising, innovative, scientific, industrious, efficient
and willing to change. People in the east - or in Africa and South America - were
considered traditional, lazy, superstitious, and resistant to change."

historians divided the history of India into three 
periods: “Hindu”, “Muslim” and “British”.  This division 
was based on the idea that the religion of rulers was the 
only important historical change, and that there were

this, it was necessary to introduce European manners, arts, 
institutions and laws in India. Mill, in fact, suggested that the 
British should conquer all the territories in India to ensure 
the enlightenment and happiness of the Indian people. For 
India was not capable of progress without British help.
In this idea of history, British rule represented all the forces 
of progress and civilisation. The period before British rule was 
one of darkness. Can such a conception be accepted today?
In any case, can we refer to any period of history as “Hindu” 
or “Muslim”? Did not a variety of faiths exist simultaneously 
in these periods? Why should we characterise an age only 
through the religion of the rulers of the time? To do so is to 
suggest that the lives and practices of the others do not really 
matter. We should also remember that even rulers in ancient

Not all officials shared these views. Many were very

From the early nineteenth century, many British officials 
began to criticise the Orientalist vision of learning. They 
said that knowledge of the East was full of errors and

Why did James Mill think British rule was necessary for India?,"According to James Mill's views, British rule was necessary for India because he believed that all Asian societies, including Indian society, were at a lower level of civilization than Europe. He thought that before the British came to India, Hindu and Muslim despots ruled the country, characterized by religious intolerance, caste taboos, and superstitious practices. Mill felt that British rule could civilize India, bringing it out of its supposedly primitive state.","According to the provided text, James Mill thought British rule could civilise India because he believed that before the British came, Hindu and Muslim despots ruled the country, and religious intolerance, caste taboos, and superstitious practices dominated social life.

Aurangzeb was the last of the powerful Mughal rulers. He 
established control over a very large part of the territory 
that is now known as India. After his death in 1707, 
many Mughal governors (subadars) and big zamindars 
began asserting their authority and establishing regional 
kingdoms. As powerful regional kingdoms emerged in 
various parts of India, Delhi could no longer function as 
an effective centre.
By the second half of the eighteenth century, 
however, a new power was emerging on the political 
horizon – the British. Did you know that the British 
originally came as a small trading company and were 
reluctant to acquire territories? How then did they come 
to be masters of a vast empire? In this chapter you will 
see how this came about.

What is the problem with dividing history into Hindu and Muslim periods?,"According to the context, one problem with dividing history into Hindu and Muslim periods is that it suggests that only the religion of the rulers matters, implying that the lives and practices of others do not really matter. Additionally, the context notes that even ancient Indian rulers did not all share the same faith, which further highlights the limitations of this periodization.","The problem with dividing history into Hindu and Muslim periods is that this division is based on the idea that the religion of rulers was the only important historical change, ignoring the rich diversity of the subcontinent.

In the middle of the nineteenth century, British 
historians divided the history of India into three 
periods: “Hindu”, “Muslim” and “British”.  This division

this, it was necessary to introduce European manners, arts, 
institutions and laws in India. Mill, in fact, suggested that the 
British should conquer all the territories in India to ensure 
the enlightenment and happiness of the Indian people. For 
India was not capable of progress without British help.
In this idea of history, British rule represented all the forces 
of progress and civilisation. The period before British rule was 
one of darkness. Can such a conception be accepted today?
In any case, can we refer to any period of history as “Hindu” 
or “Muslim”? Did not a variety of faiths exist simultaneously 
in these periods? Why should we characterise an age only 
through the religion of the rulers of the time? To do so is to 
suggest that the lives and practices of the others do not really 
matter. We should also remember that even rulers in ancient

along. When historians study, say, a king or queen of 1,500

many sources as they can find and consult. Sometimes, the

Few historians follow this periodisation today. Most 
look to economic and social factors to characterise 
the major elements of different moments of the past. 
The histories you read last year included a wide range 
of early societies – hunter-gatherers, early farmers, 
people living in towns and villages, and early empires 
and kingdoms. The histories you will be studying this 
more about the spread of peasant societies, the rise of 
regional and imperial state formations – sometimes at 
the cost of pastoral and forest people – the development 
of Hinduism and Islam as major religions and the 
arrival of European trading companies.  
 These thousand years of Indian history witnessed 
considerable change. After all, the sixteenth and 
eighteenth centuries were quite different from the 
eighth or the eleventh. Therefore, describing the entire 
period as one historical unit is not without its problems.

Moving away from British classification, historians 
have usually divided Indian history into ‘ancient’, ‘medieval’ 
and ‘modern’. This division too has its problems. It is a 
periodisation that is borrowed from the West where the 
modern period was associated with the growth of all the  
forces of modernity – science, reason, democracy, liberty 
and equality. Medieval was a term used to describe a society 
where these features of modern society did not exist. Can 
we uncritically accept this characterisation of the modern 
period to describe the period of our study? As you will see in 
this book, under British rule people did not have equality, 
freedom or liberty. Nor was the period one of economic 
growth and progress.

How did British rule change Indian society?,"According to the provided context, British rule changed Indian society by introducing reforms aimed at changing social practices. The British passed laws to stop sati and encourage widow remarriage, promoted English-language education, allowed Christian missionaries to function freely, and made conversion to Christianity easier. This led many Indians to feel that their religion, customs, and traditional way of life were being destroyed.","Based on the provided context, British rule changed Indian society in the following ways:

*   **Education:** English-language education was promoted.
*   **Religion:** Christian missionaries were allowed to function freely and own land. A law was passed to make conversion to Christianity easier, allowing converts to inherit ancestral property.

Responses to reforms 
The British believed that Indian society had 
to be reformed. Laws were passed to stop the 
practice of sati and to encourage the remarriage 
of widows. English-language education was 
actively promoted. After 1830, the Company 
allowed Christian missionaries to function freely 
in its domain and even own land and property. In 
1850, a new law was passed to  make conversion 
to Christianity easier. This  law allowed an Indian 
who had converted to Christianity to inherit the 
property of his ancestors. Many Indians began to 
feel that the British were destroying their religion, 
their social customs and their traditional way  
of life. 
There were of course other Indians who wanted 
to change existing social practices. You will read 
about these reformers and reform movements in

In the earlier chapters, you have seen how British rule affected

will try and understand what implication it had for the lives of 
students. For, the British in India wanted not only territorial 
conquest and control over revenues. They also felt that they had 
a cultural mission: they had to “civilise the natives”, change their 
customs and values.
What changes were to be introduced? How were Indians 
to be educated, “civilised”, and made into what the British 
believed were “good subjects”? The British could find no simple 
answers to these questions. They continued to be debated for 
many decades.

was not the result of a sudden upheaval or revolution. It was the
result of  a long-drawn-out process. There was no British nation
prior to the eighteenth century. The primary identities of the people
who inhabited the British Isles were ethnic ones – such as English,
Welsh, Scot or Irish. All of these ethnic groups had their own cultural
and political traditions. But as the English nation steadily grew in
wealth, importance and power, it was able to extend its influence
over the other nations of the islands. The English parliament, which
had seized power from the monarchy in 1688 at the end of a
protracted conflict, was the instrument through which a nation-state,
with England at its centre, came to be forged. The Act of Union
(1707) between England and Scotland that resulted in the formation
of the ‘United Kingdom of Great Britain’ meant, in effect, that
England was able to impose its influence on Scotland. The British","cities developed and markets came up, how kingdoms

Which dates?
By what criteria do we choose a set of dates as 
important? The dates we select, the dates around which 
we compose our story of the past, are not important 
on their own. They become vital because we focus on 
a particular set of events as important. If our focus of 
study changes, if we begin to look at new issues, a new 
set of dates will appear significant. 
Consider an example. In the histories written by 
British historians in India, the rule of each Governor-
General was important. These histories began with the 
rule of the first Governor-General, Warren Hastings, 
and ended with the last Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten. In 
separate chapters, we read about the deeds of others  —

How do We Know?
What sources do historians use in writing about the last 
250 years of Indian history? 
Administration produces records
One important source is the official records of the British 
administration. The British believed that the act of writing 
was important. Every instruction, plan, policy decision, 
agreement, investigation had to be clearly written up. Once 
this was done, things could be properly studied and debated. 
This conviction produced an administrative culture of 
memos, notings and reports. 
The British also felt that all important documents 
and letters needed to be carefully preserved. So they 
set up record rooms attached to all administrative 
institutions. The village tahsildar’s office, the collectorate, 
the commissioner’s office, the provincial secretariats, 
the lawcourts – all had their record rooms. Specialised 
institutions like archives and museums were also 
established to preserve important records.","the lawcourts – all had their record rooms. Specialised

archives. You can also study the notes and reports 
that district officials prepared, or the instructions 
and directives that were sent by officials at the top to 
provincial administrators. 
In the early years of the nineteenth century, these 
documents were carefully copied out and beautifully 
written by calligraphists – that is, by those who specialised 
in the art of beautiful writing. By the middle of the 
nineteenth century, with the spread of printing, multiple 
copies of these records were printed as proceedings of each

Second: print created a new culture of dialogue and debate. All
values, norms and institutions were re-evaluated and discussed by a
public that had become aware of the power of reason, and
recognised the need to question existing ideas and beliefs. Within

tales narrated. Knowledge was transferred orally. People collectively
heard a story, or saw a performance. As you will see in Chapter 8,
they did not read a book individually and silently. Before the age of
print, books were not only expensive but they could not be produced
in sufficient numbers. Now books could reach out to wider sections
of people. If earlier there was a hearing public, now a reading public
came into being.
But the transition was not so simple. Books could be read only by
the literate, and the rates of literacy in most European countries
were very low till the twentieth century. How, then, could publishers
persuade the common people to welcome the printed book? To do
this, they had to keep in mind the wider reach of the printed work:
even those who did not read could certainly enjoy listening to books
being read out. So printers began publishing popular ballads and","INTRODUCTION: HOW, WHEN AND WHERE         7

lay behind their actions. 
For that we need to look elsewhere. When we begin to

though they are more difficult to get than official records. 
We have diaries of people, accounts of pilgrims and 
travellers, autobiographies of important personalities, and 
popular booklets that were sold in the local bazaars. As 
printing spread, newspapers were published and issues 
were debated in public. Leaders and reformers wrote to

their feelings.

All such historical questions refer us back to 
notions of time. But time does not have to be always 
precisely dated in terms of a particular year or a month. 
Sometimes it is actually incorrect to fix precise dates 
to processes that happen over a period of time. People 
in India did not begin drinking tea one fine day; they 
developed a taste for it over time. There can be no 
one clear date for a process such as this. Similarly, 
we cannot fix one single date on which British rule 
was established, or the national movement started, or 
changes took place within the economy and society. All 
these things happened over a stretch of time. We can 
only refer to a span of time, an approximate period over 
which particular changes became visible.
Why, then, do we continue to associate history with 
a string of dates? This association has a reason. There

What was the Scramble for Africa?,"According to the context, the Scramble for Africa refers to the process of European imperial powers carving up the continent into different colonies in the late 19th century.

went with arms, mobilised local hunters,
warriors and labourers to help him, fought
with local tribes, investigated African
terrains, and mapped different regions.
These explorations helped the conquest
of Africa. Geographical explorations were
not driven by an innocent search for
scientific information. They were directly
linked to imperial projects.

Look at a map of Africa (Fig. 10). You
will see some countries’ borders run
straight, as if they were drawn using a
ruler. Well, in fact this was almost how
rival European powers in Africa drew up
the borders demarcating their respective
territories. In 1885 the big European

carving up of Africa between them.
Britain and France made vast additions to
their overseas territories in the late nineteenth
century. Belgium and Germany became new

over some colonies earlier held by Spain.

We will discuss some of these changes by looking at one pastoral
community – the Maasai – in some detail. The Maasai cattle herders
live primarily in east Africa: 300, 000 in southern Kenya and another
150,000 in Tanzania. We will see how new laws and regulations took
away their land and restricted their movement. This affected their
lives in times of drought and even reshaped their social relationships.
3.1 Where have the Grazing Lands Gone?
One of the problems the Maasais have faced is the continuous loss of
their grazing lands. Before colonial times, Maasailand stretched over
a vast area from north Kenya to the steppes of northern Tanzania.
In the late nineteenth century, European imperial powers scrambled
for territorial possessions in Africa, slicing up the region into different
colonies. In 1885, Maasailand was cut into half with an international
boundary between British Kenya and German Tanganyika."

In the medieval period, a “foreigner” was any stranger 
who appeared say in a given village, someone who was 
not a part of that society or culture. (In Hindi the term 
 might be used to describe such a person and 
in Persian, .) A city-dweller, therefore, might 
have regarded a forest-dweller as a “foreigner”, but two 
peasants living in the same village were not foreigners 
to each other, even though they may have had different 
religious or caste backgrounds.

and Harshavardhana. In this book we will read about 
the following thousand years, from roughly 700 to 1750.

How were paintings used to portray British rule?,"According to the context, paintings were used to portray British rule by depicting Indian culture and society in a way that was favorable to British dominance. For example, the image of Rennel's enthusiastic supporter of British conquest of India shows Indians willingly giving over their ancient texts to Britannia (the symbol of British power) as if asking her to become the protector of Indian culture. This painting projects an imperial perception by portraying Indian people as willing collaborators with British rule.","Paintings were used to portray British rule through images that were mass-produced and widely circulated. These images, like the one depicting Indians willingly giving their texts to Britannia, shaped popular perceptions by suggesting that British rule was a protector of Indian culture. Caricatures also played a role, sometimes ridiculing Indian fascination with Western culture or, conversely, lampooning nationalists and criticizing imperial rule.
","culture was taking shape. With the setting up of an
increasing number of printing presses, visual images
could be easily reproduced in multiple copies. Painters
like Raja Ravi Varma produced ima ges for mass

woodblocks set up shop near the letterpresses, and
were employed by print shops. Cheap prints and
calendars, easily available in the bazaar, could be
bought even by the poor to decorate the walls of
their homes or places of work. These prints began
shaping popular ideas about modernity and tradition,
religion and politics, and society and culture.
By the 1870s, caricatures and cartoons were being
published in journals and newspapers, commenting
on social and political issues. Some carica tures
ridiculed the educated Indians’ fascination with
Western tastes and clothes, while others expressed
the fear of social change. There were imperial
caricatures lampooning nationalists, as well as
nationalist cartoons criticising imperial rule.","An enthusiastic supporter 
of British conquest of India, 
Rennel saw preparation of maps 
as essential to the process of

British power – as if asking her 
to become the protector of Indian

He set out to conquer neighbouring European countries, dispossessing
dynasties and creating kingdoms where he placed members of his family.

laws such as the protection of private property and a uniform system of
weights and measures provided by the decimal system. Initiall

do? Clearly, we need another format for our history. This 
would mean that the old dates will no longer have the 
significance they earlier had. A new set of dates will become 
more important for us to know.  
How do we periodise? 
In 1817, James Mill, a Scottish economist and political 
philosopher, published a massive three-volume work, 
A History of British India. In this, he divided Indian 
history into three periods – Hindu, Muslim and British. 
This periodisation came to be widely accepted. Can

this, it was necessary to introduce European manners, arts, 
institutions and laws in India. Mill, in fact, suggested that the 
British should conquer all the territories in India to ensure 
the enlightenment and happiness of the Indian people. For 
India was not capable of progress without British help.
In this idea of history, British rule represented all the forces 
of progress and civilisation. The period before British rule was 
one of darkness. Can such a conception be accepted today?
In any case, can we refer to any period of history as “Hindu” 
or “Muslim”? Did not a variety of faiths exist simultaneously 
in these periods? Why should we characterise an age only 
through the religion of the rulers of the time? To do so is to 
suggest that the lives and practices of the others do not really

A Mutiny Becomes a Popular Uprising
Though struggles between rulers and the ruled are 
not unusual, sometimes such struggles become quite 
widespread as a popular resistance so that the power 
of the state breaks down. A very large number of 
people begin to believe that they have a common enemy 
and rise up against the enemy at the same time. For 
such a situation to develop, people have to organise, 
communicate, take initiative and display the confidence 
to turn the situation around.

The Crisis of the Empire and

In Chapter 4, you saw how the Mughal Empire reached 
the height of its success and started facing a variety 
of crises towards the closing years of the seventeenth 
century. These were caused by a number of factors.

of revenue and military administration (diwani and 
faujdari) as well. This gave them extraordinary political, 
economic and military powers over vast regions of the 
Mughal Empire. As the governors consolidated their 
control over the provinces, the periodic remission of 
revenue to the capital declined.
Peasant and zamindari rebellions in many parts of 
northern and western India added to these problems. 
These revolts were sometimes caused by the pressures 
of mounting taxes. At other times they were attempts 
by powerful chieftains to consolidate their own 
positions. Mughal authority had been challenged by 
rebellious groups in the past as well. But these groups 
were now able to seize the economic resources of the 
region to consolidate their positions. The Mughal 
emperors after Aurangzeb were unable to arrest the 
gradual shifting of political and economic authority 
into the hands of provincial governors, local chieftains 
and other groups."

the Company’s traders, known at that time as “factors”,

merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory.

East India Company 
Comes East
In 1600, the East India 
Company acquired a charter 
from the ruler of England, 
Queen Elizabeth I, granting 
it the sole right to trade with 
the East. This meant that 
no other trading group in 
England could compete with 
the East India Company. With 
this charter, the Company 
could venture across the 
oceans, looking for new lands 
from which it could buy goods 
at a cheap price, and carry them back to Europe to 
sell at higher prices. The Company did not have to fear 
competition from other English trading companies. 
Mercantile trading companies in those days made profit 
primarily by excluding competition, so that they could 
buy cheap and sell dear.
The royal charter, however, could not prevent other 
European powers from entering the Eastern markets. 
By the time the first English ships sailed down the

west coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and 
crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already 
established their presence in the western coast of India, 
and had their base in Goa. In fact, it was Vasco da 
Gama, a Portuguese explorer, who had discovered this 
sea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth 
century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities 
of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders 
arrived on the scene. 
The problem was that all the companies were 
interested in buying the same things. The fine qualities 
of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market 
in Europe. Pepper, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon 
too were in great demand. Competition amongst the 
European companies inevitably pushed up the prices 
at which these goods could be purchased, and this 
reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way 
the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating"

worked on the plantations rose 
in rebellion in 1791, burning 
the plantations and killing their

abolished slavery in the French 
colonies. These events led to the

How trade led to battles
Through the early eighteenth century, the conflict between 
the Company and the nawabs of Bengal intensified.  
After the death of Aurangzeb, the Bengal nawabs 
asserted their power and autonomy, as other regional 
powers were doing at that time. Murshid Quli Khan 
was followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah 
as the Nawab of Bengal. Each one of them was a strong 
ruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions, 
demanded large tributes for the Company’s right to 
trade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it 
from extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company 
of deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving 
the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and 
undermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing 
to pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to 
humiliate the nawab and his officials. 
The Company on its part declared that the unjust","to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver 
imported from Britain. This was because at this time 
Britain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of 
gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey, and 
entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now 
revenues from India could finance Company expenses. 
These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and 
silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and 
meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices 
at Calcutta.  
Company officials become “nabobs” (nawabs)
What did it mean to be nawabs? It meant of course that 
the Company acquired more power and authority. But it 
also meant something else. Each company servant began 
to have visions of living like nawabs.

The Nawab had to pay Rs. 500,000 every month but 
the Company wanted more money to finance its wars, 
and meet the demands of trade and its other expenses. 
It wanted more territories and more revenue. By the 
time Mir Jafar died in 1765, the mood of the Company 
had changed. Having failed to work with puppet 
nawabs, Clive declared: “We must indeed become  
nawabs ourselves”.
Finally, in 1765 the Mughal emperor appointed the 
Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The 
Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue 
resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that 
the Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth 
century, its trade with India had expanded. But it had 
to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver 
imported from Britain. This was because at this time

When Alivardi Khan died in 1756, Sirajuddaulah became 
the nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about his 
power and keen on a puppet ruler who would  willingly 
give trade concessions and other privileges. So it tried, 
though without success, to help one of Sirajuddaulah’s 
rivals become the nawab. An infuriated Sirajuddaulah

driven out of Bengal, and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. 
The Nawab had to pay Rs. 500,000 every month but 
the Company wanted more money to finance its wars, 
and meet the demands of trade and its other expenses. 
It wanted more territories and more revenue. By the 
time Mir Jafar died in 1765, the mood of the Company 
had changed. Having failed to work with puppet 
nawabs, Clive declared: “We must indeed become  
nawabs ourselves”.
Finally, in 1765 the Mughal emperor appointed the 
Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The 
Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue 
resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that 
the Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth 
century, its trade with India had expanded. But it had 
to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver 
imported from Britain. This was because at this time 
Britain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of"
What was the significance of the Battle of Plassey?,"According to the context, the significance of the Battle of Plassey was the first major victory won by the East India Company in India. Additionally, the defeat of Sirajuddaulah led to Mir Jafar becoming the new nawab, which marked a turning point for the Company's territorial ambitions in India.","The Battle of Plassey was significant because it was the first major victory the Company won in India. The battle occurred after conflicts arose from the Company's desire to expand trade, enlarge settlements, buy villages, and rebuild forts, while the Nawab demanded they stop meddling in his affairs, stop fortification, and pay revenues. The Company also sought a puppet ruler who would give trade concessions and other privileges. The defeat of the Nawab was secured because Mir Jafar, one of Sirajuddaulah’s commanders, never fought the battle, as Clive had promised to make him Nawab after crushing Sirajuddaulah.

humiliate the nawab and his officials. 
The Company on its part declared that the unjust 
demands of the local officials were ruining the trade of 
the Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties 
were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade, 
it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages, and 
rebuild its forts.    
The conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated 
in the famous Battle of Plassey.

disarmed all Englishmen, and blockaded English ships. 
Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the

On hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta, 
Company officials in Madras sent forces under the

Aurangzeb was the last of the powerful Mughal rulers. He 
established control over a very large part of the territory 
that is now known as India. After his death in 1707, 
many Mughal governors (subadars) and big zamindars 
began asserting their authority and establishing regional 
kingdoms. As powerful regional kingdoms emerged in 
various parts of India, Delhi could no longer function as 
an effective centre.
By the second half of the eighteenth century, 
however, a new power was emerging on the political

In the late 1830s, the East India 
Company became worried about Russia. 
It imagined that Russia might expand 
across Asia and enter India from the 
north-west. Driven by this fear, the British 
now wanted to secure their control over 
the north-west. They fought a prolonged 
war with Afghanistan between 1838 and 
1842, and established indirect Company 
rule there. Sind was taken over in 1843. 
Next in line was Punjab. But the presence 
of Maharaja Ranjit Singh held back the 
Company. After his death in 1839, two 
prolonged wars were fought with the Sikh  
kingdom. Ultimately, in 1849, Punjab  
was annexed.

Finally, in 1856, the Company also took over Awadh.

they were “obliged by duty” to take over Awadh in order to 
free the people from the “misgovernment” of the Nawab!

What was the main goal of socialism in Europe?,"According to the context, the main goal of socialism in Europe was to change the way society is structured by making property a collective social interest rather than individual ownership.

Almost all industries were the property of individuals.  Liberals and
radicals themselves were often property owners and employers.
Having made their wealth through trade or industrial ventures, they
felt that such effort should be encouraged – that its benefits would
be achieved if the workforce in the economy was healthy and citizens
were educated. Opposed to the privileges the old aristocracy had by
birth, they firmly believed in the value of individual effort, labour
and enterprise. If freedom of individuals was ensured, if the poor
could labour, and those with capital could operate without restraint,
they believed that societies would develop. Many working men and
women who wanted changes in the world rallied around liberal and
radical groups and parties in the early nineteenth century.

1.4 Support for Socialism
By the 1870s, socialist ideas spread through Europe. To coordinate
their efforts, socialists formed an international body – namely, the
Second International.
Workers in England and Germany began forming associations to
fight for better living and working conditions. They set up funds to
help members in times of distress and demanded a reduction of working
hours and the right to vote. In Germany, these associations worked closely
with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and helped it win parliamentary
seats. By 1905, socialists and trade unionists formed a Labour Party in
Britain and a Socialist Party in France. However, till 1914, socialists never
succeeded in forming a government in Europe. Represented by strong
figures in parliamentary politics, their ideas did shape legislation, but

equal rights. After 1815, Giuseppe Mazzini, an Italian nationalist, conspired
with others to achieve this in Italy. Nationalists elsewhere – including India
– read his writings.
1.3 The Coming of Socialism to Europe
Perhaps one of the most far-reaching visions of how society should be
structured was socialism. By the mid - nineteenth century in Europe, socialism
was a well-known body of ideas that attracted widespread attention.
Socialists were against private property, and saw it as the root of all social ills
of the time. Why? Individuals owned the property that gave employment
but the propertied were concerned only with  personal gain and not with
the welfare of those who made the property productive. So if society as a
whole rather than single individuals controlled property, more attention
would be paid to collective social interests. Socialists wanted this change and
campaigned for it."

in Fig. 1. During the nineteenth century, nationalism emerged as a
force which brought about sweeping changes in the political and
mental world of Europe. The end result of these changes was the
emergence of the nation-state in place of the multi-national dynastic
empires of Europe. The concept and practices of a modern state, in
which a centralised power exercised sovereign control over a clearly
defined territory, had been developing over a long period of time
in Europe. But a nation-state was one in which the majority of its
citizens, and not only its rulers, came to develop a sense of common
identity and shared history or descent. This commonness did not
exist from time immemorial; it was forged through struggles, through
the actions of leaders and the common people. This chapter will
look at the diverse processes through which nation-states and
nationalism came into being in nineteenth-century Europe.","9
Nationalism   in    Europe
In Western and parts of Central Europe the growth of industrial
production and trade meant the growth of towns and the emergence
of commercial classes whose existence was based on production
for the market. Industrialisation began in England in the second
half of the eighteenth century, but in France and parts of the German
states it occurred only during the nineteenth century. In its wake,
new social groups came into being: a working-class population, and
middle classes made up of industrialists, businessmen, professionals.
In Central and Eastern Europe these groups were smaller in number
till late nineteenth century. It was among the educated, liberal middle
classes that ideas of national unity following the abolition of
aristocratic privileges gained popularity.

the end of autocracy and clerical privileges, a constitution and

liberals also stressed the inviolability of private property.

1.2 Industrial Society and Social Change
These political trends were signs of a new time. It was a time of
profound social and economic changes. It was a time when new cities
came up and new industrialised regions developed,  railways expanded
and the Industrial Revolution occurred.
Industrialisation brought men, women and children to factories.  Work
hours were often long and wages were poor. Unemployment was
common, particularly during times of low demand for industrial goods.
Housing and sanitation were problems since towns were growing
rapidly. Liberals and radicals searched for solutions to these issues.

All too often we associate industrialisation with the growth of

with the setting up of the first factories.
There is a problem with such ideas. Even before factories began to

industrial production for an international market. This was not based

The 1830s were years of great economic hardship in Europe. The
first half  of the nineteenth century saw an enormous increase in
population all over Europe. In most countries there were more
seekers of  jobs than emplo yment. Population from r ural areas
migrated to the cities to live in overcrowded slums. Small producers
in towns were often faced with stiff competition from imports of
cheap machine-made goods from England, where industrialisation
was more advanced than on the continent. This was especially so in
textile production, which was carried out mainly in homes or small
workshops and was only partly mechanised. In those regions of
Europe where the aristocracy still enjoyed power, peasants struggled
under the burden of feudal dues and obligations.

Why did some people support socialist ideas?,"According to the context, some people supported socialist ideas because:

* They respected Marx's ideas and wanted to coordinate their efforts through the Second International.
* They believed in workers' rights and demanded better living and working conditions, reduced working hours, and the right to vote.
* They saw peasants as natural socialists, with Russia's peasant custom of dividing land periodically making them a force for revolution.

These are the reasons mentioned in the context for why some people supported socialist ideas.","Some people supported socialist ideas because:

*   Some Russian socialists felt the Russian peasant custom of dividing land periodically made them natural socialists.
*   Socialists generally aimed to fight for better living and working conditions, reduce working hours, and gain the right to vote.","2.3 Socialism in Russia
All political parties were illegal in Russia before 1914. The Russian
Social Democratic Workers Party was founded in 1898 by socialists
who respected Marx’s ideas. However, because of government
policing, it had to operate as an illegal organisation. It set up a
newspaper, mobilised workers and organised strikes.
Some Russian socialists felt that the Russian peasant custom of dividing
land periodically made them natural socialists. So peasants, not
workers, would be the main force of the revolution, and Russia could
become socialist more quickly than other countries. Socialists were
active in the countryside through the late nineteenth century.  They
formed the Socialist Revolutionary Party in 1900. This party struggled
for peasants’ rights and demanded that land belonging to nobles be
transferred to peasants. Social Democrats disagreed with Socialist
Revolutionaries about peasants. Lenin felt that peasants were not","Socialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution

1.4 Support for Socialism
By the 1870s, socialist ideas spread through Europe. To coordinate
their efforts, socialists formed an international body – namely, the
Second International.
Workers in England and Germany began forming associations to
fight for better living and working conditions. They set up funds to
help members in times of distress and demanded a reduction of working
hours and the right to vote. In Germany, these associations worked closely
with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and helped it win parliamentary
seats. By 1905, socialists and trade unionists formed a Labour Party in
Britain and a Socialist Party in France. However, till 1914, socialists never
succeeded in forming a government in Europe. Represented by strong
figures in parliamentary politics, their ideas did shape legislation, but

2.2 Role of Technology
What was the role of technology in all this? The railways, steamships,
the telegraph, for example, were important inventions without

industries. Even at the end of the nineteenth century, less than 20 per

large portion of the output was produced not within factories, but
outside, within domestic units.
Third: the pace of change in the ‘traditional’ industries was not set
by steam-powered cotton or metal industries, but they did not remain
entirely stagnant either. Seemingly ordinary and small innovations
were the basis of growth in many non-mechanised sectors such as

The  Making  of  a  Global  World
The world changed profoundly in the nineteenth century. Economic,
political, social, cultural and technological factors interacted in
complex ways to transform societies and reshape external relations.
Economists identify three types of movement or ‘flows’ within
international economic exchanges. 
The first is the flow of trade which
in the nineteenth century referred largely to trade in goods (e.g.,
cloth or wheat). The second is the flow of labour – the migration
of people in search of employment. The third is the movement of
capital for short-term or long-term investments over long distances.
All three flows were closely interwoven and affected peoples’ lives
more deeply now than ever before. The interconnections could
sometimes be broken – for example, labour migration was often
more restricted than goods or capital flows. Yet it helps us understand
the nineteenth-century world economy better if we look at the
three flows together."

The development of nationalism did not come about only through
wars and territorial expansion. Culture played an important role in
creating the idea of  the nation: art and poetry, stories and music
helped express and shape nationalist feelings.

4  The Sense of Collective Belonging
Nationalism spreads when people begin to believe that they are all
part of the same  nation, when they discover some unity that binds
them together. But how did the nation become a reality in the minds
of people? How did people belonging to different communities,
regions or language groups develop a sense of collective belonging?
This sense of collective belonging came partly through the experience
of united struggles. But there were also a variety of cultural processes
through which nationalism captured people’s imagination. History
and fiction, folklore and songs, popular prints and symbols, all played
a part in the making of nationalism.

Nationalism   in  India
As you have seen, modern nationalism in Europe came to be
associated with the formation of nation-states. It also meant a change
in people’s understanding of who they were, and what defined their
identity and sense of belonging. New symbols and icons, new songs
and ideas forged new links and redefined the boundaries of
communities. In most countries the making of this new national
identity was a long process. How did this consciousness emerge
in India?

nationalism is intimately connected to the anti-colonial movement.

Conclusion
A growing anger against the colonial government was thus
bringing together various groups and classes of Indians into a
common struggle for freedom in the first half of the twentieth
century. The Congress under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi
tried to channel people’s grievances into organised movements
for independence. Through such movements the nationalists
tried to forge a national unity. But as we have seen, diverse groups
and classes participated in these movements with varied aspirations
and expectations. As their
grievances were wide-ranging,
freedom from colonial rule also
meant different things to
different people. The Congress
continuously attempted to
resolve differences, and ensure
that the demands of one group
did not alienate another. This is
precisely why the unity within
the movement often broke down.
The high points of Congress
activity and nationalist unity
were followed by phases of
disunity and inner conflict
between groups."

Why was the Non-Cooperation Movement launched in 1920?,"The Non-Cooperation Movement was launched in 1920 to protest British rule in India.

Many within the Congress were, however, concerned about the
proposals. They were reluctant to bo ycott the council elections
scheduled for November 1920, and they feared that the movement
might lead to popular violence.  In the months between September
and December there was an intense tussle within the Congress. For a
while there seemed no meeting point between the supporters and
the opponents of the movement. Finally, at the Congress session at
Nagpur in December 1920,  a compromise was worked out and
the Non-Cooperation programme was adopted.
How did the movement unfold? Who participated in it? How did
different social groups conceive of the idea of Non-Cooperation?

The happenings of 1922–1929
Mahatma Gandhi, as you know, was against violent 
movements. He abruptly called off the Non-Cooperation 
Movement when in February 1922, a crowd of peasants 
set fire to a police station in Chauri Chaura. Twenty- two 
policemen were killed on that day. The peasants were 
provoked because the police had fired on their peaceful 
demonstration. 
Once the Non-Cooperation movement was over, 
Gandhiji’s followers stressed that the Congress must 
undertake constructive work in the rural areas. Other 
leaders such as Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru 
argued that the party should fight elections to the councils 
and enter them in order to influence government policies. 
Through sincere social work in villages in the mid-1920s, 
the Gandhians were able to extend their support base. This 
proved to be very useful in launching the Civil Disobedience 
movement in 1930.

with the surrender of titles that the government awarded, and a
boycott of civil services, army, police, courts and legislative councils,
schools, and f

In the countryside, rich peasant communities – like the Patidars of
Gujarat and the Jats of Uttar Pradesh – were active in the movement.
Being producers of commercial crops, they were very hard hit by
the trade de pression and f alling prices . As their cash income
disappeared, they found it impossible to pay the government’s revenue
demand. And the refusal of the government to reduce the revenue
demand led to widespread resentment. These rich peasants became
enthusiastic supporters of the Civil Disobedience Movement,
organising their communities, and at times forcing reluctant members,
to participate in the boy
cott programmes. For them the fight for
swaraj was a struggle against high revenues. But they were deeply
disappointed when the movement was called off in 1931 without

What was the significance of the Salt March?,"According to the context, the significance of the Salt March was that it related the general desire for freedom to a specific grievance shared by everybody, thus uniting the rich and poor. The march also marked the beginning of the Civil Disobedience Movement, which was different from the Non-Cooperation Movement as people were now asked not only to refuse cooperation but also to peacefully defy British laws.","The Salt March was significant because it related the general desire for freedom to a specific grievance (the salt law) shared by everyone, uniting the nation by not dividing the rich and the poor.

The March to Dandi 
Purna Swaraj  would never come on its 
own. It had to be fought for. In 1930, 
Gandhiji declared that he would lead a 
march to break the salt law. According to 
this law, the state had a monopoly on the 
manufacture and sale of salt. Mahatma 
Gandhi along with other nationalists 
reasoned that it was sinful to tax salt 
since it is such an essential item of our 
food. The Salt March related the general 
desire of freedom to a specific grievance 
shared by everybody, and thus did not 
divide the rich and the poor.  
Gandhiji and his followers marched   
for over 240 miles from Sabarmati to 
the coastal town of Dandi where they 
broke the government law by gathering 
natural salt found on the seashore,  
and boiling sea water to produce salt.

salt march accompanied by 78 of his trusted volunteers. The march
was over 240 miles, from Gandhiji’s ashram in Sabarmati to the
Gujarati coastal town of Dandi. The volunteers walked for 24 days,
about 10 miles a day. Thousands came to hear Mahatma Gandhi
wherever he stopped, and he told them what he meant by swaraj
and urged them to peacefully defy the British. On 6 April he reached
Dandi, and ceremonially violated the law, manufacturing salt by
boiling sea water.
This marked the beginning of the Civil Disobedience Movement.

The liberals and moderates, who were proposing a constitutional
system within the framework of British dominion, gradually lost
their influence. In December 1929, under the presidency of Jawaharlal
Nehru, the Lahore Cong ress formalised the demand of  ‘Purna
Swaraj’ or full independence for India. It was declared that 26 January
1930, would be celebrated as the Independence Day when people
were to take a pledge to struggle for complete independence. But
the celebrations attracted very little attention. So Mahatma Gandhi
had to find a way to relate this abstract idea of freedom to more
concrete issues of everyday life.

the nation. On 31 January 1930, he sent a letter to Viceroy Irwin

we will pick up the story from the 1920s and study the Non-

how the Congress sought to develop the national movement, how
different social groups participated in the movement, and how

Conclusion
A growing anger against the colonial government was thus
bringing together various groups and classes of Indians into a
common struggle for freedom in the first half of the twentieth
century. The Congress under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi
tried to channel people’s grievances into organised movements
for independence. Through such movements the nationalists
tried to forge a national unity. But as we have seen, diverse groups
and classes participated in these movements with varied aspirations
and expectations. As their
grievances were wide-ranging,
freedom from colonial rule also
meant different things to
different people. The Congress
continuously attempted to
resolve differences, and ensure
that the demands of one group
did not alienate another. This is
precisely why the unity within
the movement often broke down.

War with the Marathas 
From the late eighteenth century, the Company also 
sought to curb and eventually destroy Maratha power. 
With their defeat in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, 
the Marathas’ dream of ruling from Delhi was shattered. 
They were divided into many states under different chiefs 
(sardars) belonging to dynasties such as Sindhia, Holkar, 
Gaikwad and Bhonsle. These chiefs were held together 
in a confederacy under a Peshwa (Principal Minister) 
who became its effective military and administrative head 
based in Pune. Mahadji Sindhia and Nana Phadnis were 
two famous Maratha soldiers and statesmen of the late 
eighteenth century.

The claim to paramountcy
It is clear from the above that from the early 
nineteenth century, the Company pursued an aggressive 
policy of territorial expansion. Under Lord Hastings 
(Governor-General from 1813 to 1823), a new policy of 
“paramountcy” was initiated. Now the Company claimed 
that its authority was paramount or supreme, hence its 
power was greater than that of Indian states. In order 
to protect its interests, it was justified in annexing or 
threatening to annex any Indian kingdom. This view","east; and into Karnataka and the Tamil and Telugu

but it came at a price. These military campaigns also 
made other rulers hostile towards the Marathas. As a 
result, they were not inclined to support the Marathas  
during the third battle of Panipat in 1761.
Alongside endless military campaigns, the Marathas 
developed an effective administrative system as well. 
Once conquest had been completed and Maratha rule 
was secure, revenue demands were gradually introduced 
taking local conditions into account. Agriculture was 
encouraged and trade revived. This allowed Maratha

How was the British army in India different from the Mughal army?,"According to the context, the British army in India was different from the Mughal army in the following ways:

* The British army adopted a professional training system for its infantry regiments, whereas the Mughal army relied mainly on cavalry and did not consider having a large professionally trained infantry.
* The British army's military culture became uniform in the early 19th century, whereas the Mughal army's traditions were not documented as being uniform or standardized.

Note: These differences are based solely on the provided context and do not imply any other aspects of the two armies.","The British army in India, or sepoy army, increasingly relied on infantry regiments equipped with muskets and matchlocks, especially after the 1820s. In contrast, the Mughal army was primarily composed of cavalry and infantry, with the cavalry dominating and less emphasis on a large, professionally trained infantry. Also, as the excerpt mentions, East India Company adopted the method when it began recruitment for its own recruiting peasants into their armies and training them as professional soldiers. While the Mughal army relied on armed peasants and zamindars for foot soldiers.
","power and patronage that steadily replaced previous 
holders of authority.
The Company army
Colonial rule in India brought in some new ideas of 
administration and reform but its power rested on its 
military strength. The Mughal army was mainly composed 
of cavalry (sawars: trained soldiers on horseback) and 
infantry, that is, paidal (foot) soldiers. They were given 
training in archery (teer-andazi) and the use of the sword. 
The cavalry dominated the army and the Mughal state 
did not feel the need to have a large professionally trained 
infantry. The rural areas had a large number of armed 
peasants and the local zamindars often supplied the 
Mughals with paidal soldiers.
A change occurred in the eighteenth century when 
Mughal successor states like Awadh and Banaras started 
recruiting peasants into their armies and training them 
as professional soldiers. The East India Company adopted 
the same method when it began recruitment for its own","recruiting peasants into their armies and training them 
as professional soldiers. The East India Company adopted 
the same method when it began recruitment for its own 
army, which came to be known as the sepoy army (from 
the Indian word sipahi, meaning soldier). 
As warfare technology changed from the 1820s, the 
cavalry requirements of the Company’s army declined. 
This is because the British empire was fighting in 
Burma, Afghanistan and Egypt where soldiers were 
armed with muskets and matchlocks. The soldiers of 
the Company’s army had to keep pace with changing 
military requirements and its infantry regiments now 
became more important. 
In the early nineteenth century, the British began

How do We Know?
What sources do historians use in writing about the last 
250 years of Indian history? 
Administration produces records
One important source is the official records of the British 
administration. The British believed that the act of writing 
was important. Every instruction, plan, policy decision, 
agreement, investigation had to be clearly written up. Once 
this was done, things could be properly studied and debated. 
This conviction produced an administrative culture of 
memos, notings and reports. 
The British also felt that all important documents 
and letters needed to be carefully preserved. So they 
set up record rooms attached to all administrative 
institutions. The village tahsildar’s office, the collectorate, 
the commissioner’s office, the provincial secretariats, 
the lawcourts – all had their record rooms. Specialised 
institutions like archives and museums were also 
established to preserve important records.","60 OUR PASTS – III

land would not be denied. Nevertheless, hundreds of 
sepoys, rebels, nawabs and rajas were tried and hanged. 
Aftermath
The British had regained control 
of the country by the end of 1859, 
but they could not carry on ruling 
the land with the same policies 
any more. 
Given below are the important 
changes that were introduced by 
the British. 
1. The British Parliament passed 
a new Act in 1858 and transferred the 
powers of the East India Company to 
the British Crown in  order to ensure 
a more responsible management 
of Indian affairs. A member of the 
British Cabinet was appointed Secretary of State for 
India and made responsible for all matters related to the 
governance of India. He was given a council to advise 
him, called the India Council. The Governor-General of 
India was given the title of Viceroy, that is, a personal 
representative of the Crown. Through these measures,"
How did the British use technology to strengthen their control over India?,"According to the context, the British used steam technology to strengthen their control over India by reducing the journey time to three weeks, enabling more Britishers and their families to come to a far-off country like India. This allowed for a greater presence of British officials and influence in India.","The British used new steam technology to strengthen their control over India.

Throughout the eighteenth century there was little criticism of slavery

the rights of man should be extended to all French subjects including
those in the colonies. But it did not pass any laws, fearing opposition

The need to improve agriculture
If the economy was in ruins, could the Company be certain

feel that investment in land had to be encouraged and 
agriculture had to be improved.

on the question, the Company finally introduced the

Settled peasants were easier to control and administer 
than people who were always on the move. The British 
also wanted a regular revenue source for the state. 
So they introduced land settlements – that is, they 
measured the land, defined the rights of each individual 
to that land, and fixed the revenue demand for the 
state. Some peasants were declared landowners, others 
tenants. As you have seen (Chapter 2), the tenants were 
to pay rent to the landowner who in turn paid revenue 
to the state.
The British effort to settle jhum cultivators was not 
very successful. Settled plough cultivation is not easy in 
areas where water is scarce and the soil is dry. In fact, 
jhum cultivators who took to plough cultivation often 
suffered, since their fields did not produce good yields. 
So the jhum cultivators in north-east India insisted 
on continuing with their traditional practice. Facing"

Birsa was born in the mid-1870s. The son of a poor father, 
he grew up around the forests of Bohonda, grazing sheep, 
playing the flute, and dancing in the local akhara. Forced 
by poverty, his father had to move from place to place 
looking for work. As an adolescent, Birsa heard tales of 
the Munda uprisings of the past and saw the sirdars 
(leaders) of the community urging the people to revolt. 
They talked of a golden age when the Mundas had been 
free of the oppression of dikus, and said there would be 
a time when the ancestral right of the community would 
be restored. They saw themselves as the descendants of 
the original settlers of the region, fighting for their land 
(mulk ki larai), reminding people of the need to win back 
their kingdom.

sacred thread, and began to value the importance of purity 
and piety.
Birsa was deeply influenced by many of the ideas he 
came in touch with in his growing-up years. His movement

planted trees and orchards, practised cultivation to 
earn their living. They did not kill their brethren and 
relatives. They lived honestly. Birsa also wanted people 
to once again work on their land, settle down and 
cultivate their fields.

Birsa went to the local missionary school, and listened 
to the sermons of missionaries. There too he heard it said 
that it was possible for the Mundas to attain the Kingdom 
of Heaven, and regain their lost rights. This would be 
possible if they became good Christians and gave up their 
“bad practices”. Later Birsa also spent some time in the 
company of a prominent Vaishnav preacher. He wore the 
sacred thread, and began to value the importance of purity 
and piety.
Birsa was deeply influenced by many of the ideas he 
came in touch with in his growing-up years. His movement 
was aimed at reforming tribal society. He urged the Mundas 
to give up drinking liquor, clean their village, and stop 
believing in witchcraft and sorcery. But we must remember 
that Birsa also turned against missionaries and landlords. 
He saw them as outside forces that were ruining the Munda

In 1895, a man named Birsa was seen roaming the forests and 
villages of Chottanagpur in Jharkhand. People said he had 
miraculous powers – he could cure all diseases and multiply 
grain. Birsa himself declared that God had appointed him 
to save his people from trouble, free them from the slavery 
of dikus (outsiders). Soon thousands began following Birsa, 
believing that he was bhagwan (God) and had come to solve 
all their problems.
Birsa was born in a family of Mundas – a tribal group 
that lived in Chottanagpur. But his followers included 
other tribals of the region – Santhals and Oraons. All of 
them in different ways were unhappy with the changes 
they were experiencing and the problems they were facing 
under British rule. Their familiar ways of life seemed to be 
disappearing, their livelihoods were under 
threat, and their religion appeared to be  
in danger.

The land policies of the British were destroying their 
traditional land system, landlords and moneylenders were 
taking over their land, and missionaries were criticising

As the movement spread the British officials decided to 
act. They arrested Birsa in 1895, convicted him on charges 
of rioting and jailed him for two years. 
When Birsa was released in 1897, he began touring 
the villages to gather support. He used traditional 
symbols and language to rouse people, urging them 
to destroy “Ravana” (dikus and the Europeans) and 
establish a kingdom under his leadership. Birsa’s 
followers began targeting the symbols of diku and

Why do pastoralists move from one place to another?,"According to the context, pastoralists move from one place to another in search of pastures and forage. Traditionally, nomadic pastoralists moved from place to place to survive bad times and avoid crises, such as droughts.","Pastoralists move from place to place because they are nomadic and this allows them to survive bad times and avoid crises when rains fail and pastures are dry.

and warriors, was disturbed, though it did not break down
entirely. Second, a new distinction between the wealthy and poor
pastoralists developed.
Conclusion
So we see that pastoral communities in different parts of the world
are affected  in a variety of different ways by changes in the modern
world. New laws and new borders affect the patterns of their
movement. With increasing restrictions on their mobility,
pastoralists find it difficult to move in search of pastures. As pasture
lands disappear grazing becomes a problem, while pastures that
remain deteriorate through continuous over grazing. Times of
drought become times of crises, when cattle die in large numbers.
Yet, pastoralists do adapt to new times. They change the paths of
their annual movement, reduce their cattle numbers, press for rights
to enter new areas, exert political pressure on the government for
relief, subsidy and other forms of support and demand a right in","Pastoralists in the Modern World

both their pastoral and trading activities. Earlier, pastoralists not
only looked after animal herds but traded in various products. The
restrictions under colonial rule did not entirely stop their trading
activities but they were now subject to various restrictions.
3.3 When Pastures Dry
Drought affects the life of pastoralists everywhere. When rains fail
and pastures are dry, cattle are likely to starve unless they can be
moved to areas where forage is available. That is why, traditionally,
pastoralists are nomadic; they move from place to place. This
nomadism allows them to survive bad times and avoid crises.
But from the colonial period, the Maasai were bound down to a
fixed area, confined within a reserve, and prohibited from moving
in search of pastures. They were cut off from the best grazing lands
and forced to live within a semi-arid tract prone to frequent droughts.
Since they could not shift their cattle to places where pastures were","the animals provide.
Over the years, some richer pastoralists began buying land and
settling down, giving up their nomadic life. Some became settled
peasants cultivating land, others took to more extensive trading.
Many poor pastoralists, on the other hand, borrowed money from
moneylenders to survive. At times they lost their cattle and sheep
and became labourers, working on fields or in small towns.
Yet, pastoralists not only continue to survive, in many regions
their numbers have expanded over recent decades. When
pasturelands in one place was closed to them, they changed the
direction of their movement, reduced the size of the herd, combined
pastoral activity with other forms of income and adapted to the
changes in the modern world. Many ecologists believe that in dry
regions and in the mountains, pastoralism is still ecologically the
most viable form of life.
Such changes were not  experienced only  by pastoral communities"
Why were tribals unhappy under British rule?,"According to the context, tribals were unhappy under British rule because they lost their administrative power and autonomy. The British officials considered settled tribal groups like the Gonds and Santhals as more civilized than hunter-gatherers or shifting cultivators, viewing them as ""wild"" and ""savage"". This led to a loss of economic power and control over their territories, ultimately affecting their way of life.","Tribals were unhappy under British rule for several reasons:

*   **Loss of Power for Tribal Chiefs:** Tribal chiefs lost much of their administrative power and were forced to follow laws made by the British. While they could keep land titles and rent out lands, their authority was significantly reduced.
*   **Restrictions on Shifting Cultivators:** The context mentions that shifting cultivators faced problems under British rule, though it doesn't specify what those problems were.
*   **Anger against the Dikus:** The context refers to the ""anger of the tribals against the dikus"" but does not specify who they were or why the tribals were angry.","British officials saw settled tribal groups like the Gonds

How did Colonial Rule Affect Tribal Lives?
The lives of tribal groups changed during British rule. Let 
us see what these changes were.
What happened to tribal chiefs?
Before the arrival of the British, in many areas the tribal 
chiefs were important people. They enjoyed a certain 
amount of economic power and had the right to administer 
and control their territories. In some places they had 
their own police and decided on the local rules of land 
and forest management. Under British rule, the functions 
and powers of the tribal chiefs changed considerably. 
They were allowed to keep their land titles over a cluster 
of villages and rent out lands, but they lost much of their 
administrative power and were forced to follow laws made","50 OUR PASTS – III

How did tribal societies differ from caste-based societies?,"According to the context, tribal societies differed from caste-based societies in the following ways:

* Tribal societies were united by kinship bonds, whereas caste-based societies had a rigid hierarchy based on social classes.
* In tribal societies, members controlled land and pastures jointly and divided them among households according to their own rules. In contrast, caste-based societies were characterized by a division of people into numerous unequal classes.
* Tribal societies retained their freedom and preserved their separate culture, whereas caste-based societies became more hierarchical and rigid over time.

These differences suggest that tribal societies were more decentralized, egalitarian, and autonomous compared to caste-based societies which were more centralized, stratified, and bound by social rules.","Tribal societies differed from caste-based societies in that they did not follow the social rules and rituals prescribed by the Brahmanas, nor were they divided into numerous unequal classes. Tribal societies were united by kinship bonds and controlled land and pastures jointly.
","50
Members of each tribe were united by kinship 
bonds. Many tribes obtained their livelihood from 
agriculture. Others were hunter-gatherers or herders. 
Most often they combined these activities to make 
full use of the natural resources of the area in which 
they lived. Some tribes were nomadic and moved 
from one place to another. A tribal group controlled 
land and pastures jointly, and divided these amongst 
households according to its own rules. 
Many large tribes thrived in different parts of the 
subcontinent. They usually lived in forests, hills, 
clashed with the more powerful caste-based societies. 
In various ways, the tribes retained their freedom and 
preserved their separate culture. 
But the caste-based and tribal societies also 
depended on each other for their diverse needs. This 
caused both societies to change.

because different kinds of societies evolved 
differently. It is important to understand 
how and why this happened.
In large parts of the subcontinent, society 
was already divided according to the rules 
of . These rules, as prescribed by the 
Brahmanas, were accepted by the rulers 
of large kingdoms. The difference between 
the high and low, and between the rich and 
poor, increased. Under the Delhi Sultans 
and the Mughals, this hierarchy between 
social classes grew further.

What is jhum cultivation?,"According to the context, jhum cultivation is a traditional practice of shifting cultivation done on small patches of land, mostly in forests.

So the jhum cultivators in north-east India insisted

parts of the forest.

Forest laws and their impact
The life of tribal groups, as you have seen, was directly 
connected to the forest. So changes in forest laws had a 
considerable effect on tribal lives. The British extended 
their control over all forests and declared that forests were 
state property. Some forests were classified as Reserved 
Forests for they produced timber which the British wanted. 
In these forests people were not allowed to move freely, 
practise jhum cultivation, collect fruits, or hunt animals. 
How were jhum cultivators to survive in such a situation? 
Many were therefore forced to move to other areas in search 
of work and livelihood. 
But once the British stopped the tribal people from 
living inside forests, they faced a problem. From where 
would the Forest Department get its labour to cut trees 
for railway sleepers and to transport logs?
Colonial officials came up with a solution. They decided"

around with things for sale, and sold the goods at high

high. So for the tribals, market and commerce often 
meant debt and poverty. They therefore came to see 
the moneylender and trader as evil outsiders and the 
cause of their misery.

They were pastoralists who moved with their herds of 
cattle or sheep according to the seasons.  When the grass

Colonial officials came up with a solution. They decided","made working plans for forest management. They planned how much
of the  plantation area to cut every year. The area  cut was then to be
replanted so that it was ready to be cut again in some years.
After the Forest Act was enacted in 1865, it was amended twice,
once in 1878 and then in 1927. The 1878 Act divided forests into
three categories: reserved, protected and village forests. The best
forests were called ‘reserved forests’. Villagers could not take anything
from these forests, even for their own use. For house building or
fuel, they could take wood from protected or village forests.
2.1 How were the Lives of People Affected?
Foresters and villagers had very different ideas of what a good forest
should look like. Villagers wanted forests with a mixture of species
to satisfy different needs – fuel, fodder, leaves. The forest department
on the other hand wanted trees which were suitable for building

How did the British try to settle shifting cultivators?,"According to the context, the British tried to settle shifting cultivators by introducing land settlements, measuring the land, defining individual rights, and fixing revenue demands. They wanted tribal groups to settle down and become peasant cultivators, making it easier for them to control and administer. However, this effort was not successful as the jhum cultivators preferred to continue their traditional practice of shifting cultivation, even when they tried plough cultivation.","The British tried to settle shifting cultivators by:

*   Measuring the land.
*   Defining individual land rights.
*   Fixing revenue demands.
*   Declaring some peasants landowners and others tenants.

The British effort to settle jhum cultivators was not very successful, as settled plough cultivation was difficult in areas with scarce water and dry soil, leading to poor yields.
","They were allowed to keep their land titles over a cluster 
of villages and rent out lands, but they lost much of their 
administrative power and were forced to follow laws made 
by British officials in India. They also had to pay tribute 
to the British, and discipline the tribal groups on behalf 
of the British. They lost the authority they had earlier 
enjoyed amongst their people, and were unable to fulfil 
their traditional functions.
What happened to the shifting cultivators?

about and did not have a fixed home. They wanted tribal

groups to settle down and become peasant cultivators. 
Settled peasants were easier to control and administer 
than people who were always on the move. The British 
also wanted a regular revenue source for the state. 
So they introduced land settlements – that is, they 
measured the land, defined the rights of each individual 
to that land, and fixed the revenue demand for the 
state. Some peasants were declared landowners, others 
tenants. As you have seen (Chapter 2), the tenants were 
to pay rent to the landowner who in turn paid revenue 
to the state.
The British effort to settle jhum cultivators was not 
very successful. Settled plough cultivation is not easy in 
areas where water is scarce and the soil is dry. In fact, 
jhum cultivators who took to plough cultivation often 
suffered, since their fields did not produce good yields. 
So the jhum cultivators in north-east India insisted

All was not well
Within a few years after the new systems were imposed, 
it was clear that all was not well with them. Driven by 
the desire to increase the income from land, revenue 
officials fixed too high a revenue demand. Peasants were 
unable to pay, ryots fled the countryside, and villages 
became deserted in many regions. Optimistic officials 
had imagined that the new systems would transform 
the peasants into rich enterprising farmers. But this 
did not happen.

The British also realised that the countryside could 
not only yield revenue, it could also grow the crops 
that Europe required. By the late eighteenth century, 
the Company was trying its best to expand the 
cultivation of opium and indigo. In the century and

The lives of tribal groups changed during British rule. Let 
us see what these changes were.
What happened to tribal chiefs?
Before the arrival of the British, in many areas the tribal 
chiefs were important people. They enjoyed a certain 
amount of economic power and had the right to administer 
and control their territories. In some places they had 
their own police and decided on the local rules of land 
and forest management. Under British rule, the functions 
and powers of the tribal chiefs changed considerably.

Many tribal groups reacted against the 
colonial forest laws. They disobeyed the 
new rules, continued with practices that 
were declared illegal, and at times rose 
in open rebellion. Such was the revolt of 
Songram Sangma in 1906  in Assam, and 
the forest satyagraha of the 1930s in the 
Central Provinces.
The problem with trade
During the nineteenth century, tribal 
groups found that traders and money-
lenders were coming into the forests more 
often, wanting to buy forest produce, 
offering cash loans, and asking them to 
work for wages. It took tribal groups some 
time to understand the consequences of 
what was happening.
Let us consider the case of the silk 
growers. In the eighteenth century, Indian 
silk was in demand in European markets. 
The fine quality of Indian silk was highly 
valued and exports from India increased 
rapidly. As the market expanded, East India Company"
What was the significance of Birsa Munda’s movement?,"According to the context, the significance of Birsa Munda's movement was to drive out missionaries, moneylenders, landlords, and the government and set up a Munda Raj with Birsa at its head.

He saw them as outside forces that were ruining the Munda

In 1895, Birsa urged his followers to recover their 
glorious past. He talked of  a golden age in the past – a 
satyug (the age of truth) – when Mundas lived a good 
life, constructed embankments, tapped natural springs, 
planted trees and orchards, practised cultivation to 
earn their living. They did not kill their brethren and 
relatives. They lived honestly. Birsa also wanted people 
to once again work on their land, settle down and 
cultivate their fields. 
What worried British officials most was the political 
aim of the Birsa movement, for it wanted to drive 
out missionaries, moneylenders, landlords, and the 
government and set up a Munda Raj with Birsa at 
its head. The movement identified all these forces as 
the cause of the misery the Mundas were suffering.

from my shoulders’

sang bemoaned their","their kingdom.
Birsa went to the local missionary school, and listened 
to the sermons of missionaries. There too he heard it said 
that it was possible for the Mundas to attain the Kingdom 
of Heaven, and regain their lost rights. This would be 
possible if they became good Christians and gave up their 
“bad practices”. Later Birsa also spent some time in the 
company of a prominent Vaishnav preacher. He wore the 
sacred thread, and began to value the importance of purity 
and piety.
Birsa was deeply influenced by many of the ideas he 
came in touch with in his growing-up years. His movement 
was aimed at reforming tribal society. He urged the Mundas 
to give up drinking liquor, clean their village, and stop

In the earlier chapters, you have seen how British rule affected 
rajas and nawabs, peasants and tribals. In this chapter, we 
will try and understand what implication it had for the lives of 
students. For, the British in India wanted not only territorial 
conquest and control over revenues. They also felt that they had 
a cultural mission: they had to “civilise the natives”, change their 
customs and values.
What changes were to be introduced? How were Indians 
to be educated, “civilised”, and made into what the British 
believed were “good subjects”? The British could find no simple 
answers to these questions. They continued to be debated for 
many decades.

about education in India. From the early nineteenth 
century, many thinkers from different parts of 
India began to talk of the need for a wider spread of

schools, colleges and universities, and spend more 
money on education. You will read about some of

A major problem was that the Brahman pandits gave 
different interpretations of local laws based on different 
schools of the dharmashastra. To bring about uniformity, 
in 1775 eleven pandits were asked to compile a digest 
of Hindu laws. N.B. Halhed translated this digest into 
English. By 1778, a code of Muslim laws was also compiled 
for the benefit of European judges. Under the Regulating 
Act of 1773, a new Supreme Court was established, while 
a court of appeal – the Sadar Nizamat Adalat – was also 
set up at Calcutta.

“Grave errors of the East”
From the early nineteenth century, many British officials 
began to criticise the Orientalist vision of learning. They 
said that knowledge of the East was full of errors and 
unscientific thought; Eastern literature was non-serious 
and light-hearted. So they argued that it was wrong

sharper. One of the most outspoken and influential 
of such critics of the time was Thomas Babington

What was Rabindranath Tagore’s idea of an ideal school?,"According to the context, Rabindranath Tagore's idea of an ideal school was one where children are happy, free, and creative, able to explore their own thoughts and desires.

He envisioned an ""abode of peace"" in a natural environment where children could cultivate their natural creativity, outside the rigid and restricting discipline of the British schooling system. He believed teachers should be imaginative and understand the child, fostering their curiosity. He wanted to combine elements of modern Western civilization with the best of Indian tradition, teaching science and technology alongside art, music, and dance.

Rabindranath Tagore started the institution in 1901. 
As a child, Tagore hated going to school. He found it 
suffocating and oppressive. The school appeared like a 
prison, for he could never do what he felt like doing. So 
while other children listened to the 
teacher, Tagore’s mind would 
wander away.

schooldays in Calcutta

that childhood ought to be a time of self-learning, outside the 
rigid and restricting discipline of the schooling system set up 
by the British. Teachers had to be imaginative, understand 
the child, and help the child develop her curiosity. According 
to Tagore, the existing schools killed the natural desire of the 
child to be creative, her sense of wonder. 
Tagore was of the view that creative learning could be 
encouraged only within a natural environment. So he chose to 
set up his school 100 kilometres away from Calcutta, in a rural 
setting. He saw it as an abode of peace (santiniketan), where living 
in harmony with nature, children could cultivate their natural 
creativity.

education in similar ways. There were, however, differences too.

education in similar ways. There were, however, differences too. 
Gandhiji was highly critical of Western civilisation and its worship 
of machines and technology. Tagore wanted to combine elements 
of modern Western civilisation with what he saw as the best within 
Indian tradition. He emphasised the need to teach science and 
technology at Santiniketan, along with art, music and dance. 
Many individuals and thinkers were thus thinking about the 
way a national educational system could be fashioned. Some 
wanted changes within the system set up by the British, and felt 
that the system could be extended so as to include wider sections 
of people. Others urged that alternative systems be created so 
that people were educated into a culture that was truly national. 
Who was to define what was truly national? The debate about 
what this “national education” ought to be continued till after 
independence."
What was the significance of Santiniketan?,"According to the context, Santiniketan was established by Rabindranath Tagore in 1901. The significance of Santiniketan was that it was a school where children could be happy, free, and creative, allowing them to explore their own thoughts and desires, unlike traditional schools which Tagore found suffocating and oppressive.","Santiniketan was significant because it was Rabindranath Tagore's institution, established in 1901, designed as a school radically different from those set up by the British.

 “We first tie them down to the pile” 
Rammohun Roy published many pamphlets to spread his 
ideas. Some of these were written as a dialogue between the 
advocate and critic of a traditional practice. Here is one such 
dialogue on sati: 
ADVOCATE OF SATI:
Women are by nature of inferior understanding, 
without resolution, unworthy of trust … Many of them, 
on the death of their husbands, become desirous of 
accompanying them; but to remove every chance of 
their trying to escape from the blazing fire, in burning 
them we first tie them down to the pile. 
OPPONENT OF SATI: 
When did you ever afford them a fair opportunity 
of exhibiting their natural capacity? How then can 
you accuse them of want of understanding? If, after 
instruction in knowledge and wisdom, a person cannot 
comprehend or retain what has been taught him, we 
may consider him as deficient; but if you do not educate 
women how can you see them as inferior.

The strategy adopted by 
Rammohun was used by 
later reformers as well. Whenever they wished to 
challenge a practice that seemed harmful, they tried 
to find a verse or sentence in the ancient sacred texts 
that supported their point of view. They then suggested 
that the practice as it existed at present was against 
early tradition.

These debates were often initiated by Indian reformers 
and reform groups. One such reformer was Raja 
Rammohun Roy (1772–1833). He founded a reform 
association known as the Brahmo Sabha (later known 
as the Brahmo Samaj) in Calcutta. People such as 
Rammohun Roy are described as reformers because 
they felt that changes were necessary in society, and 
unjust practices needed to be done away with. They 
thought that the best way to ensure such changes was 
by persuading people to give up old practices and adopt 
a new way of life.

Even today the Gujjar Bakarwals of Jammu and Kashmir are great
herders of goat and sheep. Many of them migrated to this region in
the nineteenth century in search of pastures for their animals.
Gradually, over the decades, they established themselves in the area,
and moved annually between their summer and winter grazing

snow, they lived with their herds in the low hills of the Siwalik
range. The dry scrub forests here provided pasture for their herds.
By the end of April they began their northern march for their summer
grazing grounds. Several households came together for this journey,
forming what is known as a kafila. They crossed the Pir Panjal passes
and entered the valley of Kashmir. With the onset of summer, the
snow melted and the mountainsides were lush green. The variety of

At the lowest rung were those who laboured to keep 
cities and villages clean or worked at jobs that upper 
castes considered “polluting”, that is, it could lead to 
the loss of caste status. The upper castes also treated 
many of these groups at the bottom as “untouchable”. 
They were not allowed to enter temples, draw water

ponds where upper castes bathed. They were seen as

8.2 Print and the Poor People
Very cheap small books were brought to markets in nineteenth-century
Madras towns and sold at crossroads, allowing poor people travelling
to markets to buy them. Public libraries were set up from the early
twentieth century, expanding the access to books. These libraries were
located mostly in cities and towns, and at times in prosperous villa
ges.
For rich local patrons, setting up a library was a way of acquiring prestige.
From the late nineteenth century, issues of caste discrimination began to
be written about in many printed tracts and essays. Jyotiba Phule, the
Maratha pioneer of ‘low caste’ protest movements, wrote about the
injustices of the caste system in his Gulamgiri (1871). In the twentieth
century, B.R. Ambedkar in Maharashtra and E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker
in Madras, better known as Periyar, wrote powerfully on caste and
their writings were read by people all over India. Local protest"
How did Dr. B.R. Ambedkar contribute to the fight against caste discrimination?,"According to the context, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar contributed to the fight against caste discrimination by:

* Writing extensively about ""upper""-caste power in contemporary society after returning to India in 1919
* Starting a temple entry movement in 1927, which aimed to make everyone equal and organized satyagraha to secure Dalits' entry into temples, public wells, tanks, roads, and schools
* Leading three such movements for temple entry between 1927 and 1935

caste reform was continued in the twentieth century 
by other great dalit leaders like Dr B.R. Ambedkar 
in western India and E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker in  
the south. 
Who could enter temples? 
Ambedkar was born into a Mahar family. As a child 
he experienced what caste prejudice meant in 
everyday life. In school he was forced to sit 
outside the classroom on the ground, and 
was not allowed to drink water from taps that  
upper-caste children used. After finishing  
school, he got a fellowship to go to the US for 
higher studies. On his return to India in 1919, he 
wrote extensively about “upper”-caste  power 
in contemporary society. 
In 1927, Ambedkar started a temple entry 
movement, in which his Mahar caste followers 
participated. Brahman priests were outraged 
when the Dalits used water from the  
temple tank. 
Ambedkar led three such movements 
for temple entry between 1927 and 
1935. His aim was to make everyone","India and the Contemporary World

or the children of God,  organised satyagraha to secure them
entry into temples, and access to public wells, tanks, roads and
schools. He himself cleaned toilets to dignify the work of the
bhangi (the sweepers), and persuaded upper castes to change
their heart and give up ‘the sin of untouchability’. But many
dalit leaders were keen on a different political solution to the
problems of the community. They began organising themselves,
demanding reserved seats in educational institutions, and a
separate electorate that would choose dalit members for
legislative councils. Political empowerment, they believed, would
resolve the problems of their social disabilities. Dalit
participation in the Civil Disobedience Movement was therefore
limited, particularly in the Maharashtra and Nagpur region
where their organisation was quite strong.
Dr B.R. Ambedkar, who organised the dalits into the
Depressed Classes Association in 1930, clashed with Mahatma","where their organisation was quite strong.
Dr B.R. Ambedkar, who organised the dalits into the
Depressed Classes Association in 1930, clashed with Mahatma
Gandhi at the second Round Table Conference by demanding
separate electorates for dalits. When the British government
conceded Ambedkar’s demand, Gandhiji began a fast unto
death. He believed that separate electorates for dalits would
slow down the process of their integration into society.
Ambedkar ultimately accepted Gandhiji’s position and the
result was the Poona Pact of September 1932. It gave the
Depressed Classes (later to be known as the Schedule Castes)
reserved seats in provincial and central legislative councils,
but they were to be voted in by the general electorate. The
dalit movement, however, continued to be apprehensive of
the Congress-led national movement.

Even today the Gujjar Bakarwals of Jammu and Kashmir are great
herders of goat and sheep. Many of them migrated to this region in
the nineteenth century in search of pastures for their animals.
Gradually, over the decades, they established themselves in the area,
and moved annually between their summer and winter grazing
grounds. In winter, when the high mountains were covered with
snow, they lived with their herds in the low hills of the Siwalik
range. The dry scrub forests here provided pasture for their herds.
By the end of April they began their northern march for their summer
grazing grounds. Several households came together for this journey,
forming what is known as a kafila. They crossed the Pir Panjal passes
and entered the valley of Kashmir. With the onset of summer, the

way they stopped once again in the villages of Lahul and Spiti, reaping
their summer harvest and sowing their winter crop. Then they descended
with their flock to their winter grazing ground on the Siwalik hills.
Next April, once again, they began their march with their goats and
sheep, to the summer meadows.
Further to the east, in Garhwal and Kumaon, the Gujjar cattle herders
came down to the  dry forests of the bhabar in the
winter, and went up to the high meadows – the
bugyals  – in summer. Many of them were
originally from Jammu and came to the UP hills in
the nineteenth century in search of good pastures.

Responses to reforms 
The British believed that Indian society had 
to be reformed. Laws were passed to stop the 
practice of sati and to encourage the remarriage 
of widows. English-language education was 
actively promoted. After 1830, the Company 
allowed Christian missionaries to function freely 
in its domain and even own land and property. In 
1850, a new law was passed to  make conversion 
to Christianity easier. This  law allowed an Indian 
who had converted to Christianity to inherit the 
property of his ancestors. Many Indians began to 
feel that the British were destroying their religion, 
their social customs and their traditional way  
of life. 
There were of course other Indians who wanted 
to change existing social practices. You will read 
about these reformers and reform movements in 
Chapter 6.

In Section I, you will read about the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution,
and the rise of Nazism. In different ways all these events were important in the
making of the modern world.
Chapter I is on the French Revolution. Today we often take the ideas of liberty,
freedom and equality for granted. But we need to remind ourselves that these ideas
also have a history. By looking at the French Revolution you will read a small part
of that history. The French Revolution led to the end of monarchy in France. A
society based on privileges gave way to a new system of governance. The Declaration
of the Rights of Man during the revolution, announced the coming of a new time.
The idea that all individuals had rights and could claim equality became part of a
new language of politics. These notions of equality and freedom emerged as the central
ideas of a new age; but in different countries they were reinterpreted and rethought","13

As conservative regimes tried to consolidate their power, liberalism
and nationalism came to be increasingly associated with revolution
in many regions of Eur
ope such as the Italian and German states,
the provinces of the Ottoman Empire, Ireland and Poland. These
revolutions were led by the liberal-nationalists belonging to the
educated middle-class elite, among whom were professors, school-
teachers, clerks and members of the commercial middle classes.
The first upheaval took place in France in July 1830.  The Bourbon
kings who had been r estored to power during the conser vative
reaction after 1815, were now overthrown by liberal revolutionaries
who installed a constitutional monarchy with Louis Philippe at its
head. ‘When France sneezes,’ Metternich once remarked, ‘the rest of
Europe catches cold.’  The July Revolution sparked an uprising in
Brussels which led to Belgium breaking away from the United"

On the morning of 14 July 1789, the city of Paris was in a state of
alarm. The king had commanded troops to move into the city. Rumours
spread that he would soon order the army to open fire upon the citizens.
Some 7,000 men and women gathered in front of the town hall and
decided to form a peoples’ militia. They broke into a number of
government buildings in search of arms.
Finally, a group of several hundred people marched towards the eastern
part of the city and stormed the fortress-prison, the Bastille, where they
hoped to find hoarded ammunition. In the armed fight that followed,
the commander of the Bastille was killed and the prisoners released –
though there were only seven of them. Yet the Bastille was hated by all,
because it stood for the despotic power of the king. The fortress was
demolished and its stone fragments were sold in the markets to all
those who wished to keep a souvenir of its destruction.","because it stood for the despotic power of the king. The fortress was

The days that followed saw more rioting both in Paris and the
countryside. Most people were protesting against the high price of bread.
Much later, when historians looked back upon this time, they saw it as
the beginning of a chain of events that ultimately led to the execution
of the king in France, though most people at the time did not anticipate
this outcome. How and why did this happen?

The  Making  of  a  Global  World
1  The Pre-modern World
When we talk of ‘globalisation’ we often refer to an economic
system that has emerged since the last 50 years or so. But as you will
see in this chapter, the making of the global world has a long
history – of trade, of migration, of people in search of work, the
movement of capital, and much else. As we think about the dramatic
and visible signs of global interconnectedness in our lives today,
we need to understand the phases through which this world in
which we live has emerged.
All through history, human societies have become steadily more
interlinked. From ancient times, travellers, traders, priests and
pilgrims travelled vast distances for knowledge, opportunity and
spiritual fulfilment, or to escape persecution. They carried goods,
money
, values, skills, ideas, inventions, and even germs and diseases.
As early as 3000 BCE an active coastal trade linked the Indus valley","57
The  Making  of  a  Global  World
The world changed profoundly in the nineteenth century. Economic,
political, social, cultural and technological factors interacted in
complex ways to transform societies and reshape external relations.
Economists identify three types of movement or ‘flows’ within
international economic exchanges. 
The first is the flow of trade which
in the nineteenth century referred largely to trade in goods (e.g.,
cloth or wheat). The second is the flow of labour – the migration
of people in search of employment. The third is the movement of
capital for short-term or long-term investments over long distances.
All three flows were closely interwoven and affected peoples’ lives
more deeply now than ever before. The interconnections could
sometimes be broken – for example, labour migration was often
more restricted than goods or capital flows. Yet it helps us understand
the nineteenth-century world economy better if we look at the
three flows together."
What is inflation?,"According to the context, inflation is described as a situation where prices rise ""phenomenally high"".

98,860,000 marks by December, the figure had run into trillions. As
the value of the mark collapsed, prices of goods soared. The image of
Germans carrying cartloads of currency notes to buy a loaf of bread
was widely publicised evoking worldwide sympathy. This crisis came
to be known as hyperinflation , a situation  when prices rise
phenomenally high.
Eventually, the Americans intervened and bailed Germany out of
the crisis by introducing the Dawes Plan, which reworked the terms
of reparation to ease the financial burden on Germans.

What is the significance of employment?,"According to the context, the significance of employment is that it provides a means of earning a living and supporting oneself and one's family. For many people, employment was essential for survival, as evident from Ram Narain Tewary's testimony about struggling to complete tasks and facing deductions in wages if work was not done satisfactorily. The context also highlights the difficulties people faced in finding employment, including competition for jobs, restrictions on entry into industries, and the role of jobbers who controlled access to work.","Based on the provided text from Ram Narain Tewary's testimony, the significance of employment, specifically indentured labor, is characterized by:

*   **Hardship:** Laborers face extremely heavy tasks they cannot complete.
*   **Punishment and Deductions:** Wages are deducted for unsatisfactory work, and laborers are punished, sometimes with imprisonment.
*   **Trouble:** Laborers spend their indenture in great difficulty.

Getting jobs was always difficult, even when mills multiplied and
the demand for workers increased. The numbers seeking work were
always more than the jobs available.  Entry into the mills was also
restricted. Industrialists usually employed a jobber to get new recruits.
Very often the jobber was an old and trusted worker. He got people
from his village, ensured them jobs, helped them settle in the city
and provided them money in times of crisis. The jobber therefore
became a per son with some authority and po wer. He be gan

The disappearance of forests is referred to as deforestation.
Deforestation is not a recent problem. The process began many
centuries ago; but under colonial rule it became more systematic and
extensive.  Let us look at some of the causes of deforestation in India.
1.1 Land to be Improved
In 1600, approximately one-sixth of India’s landmass was under
cultivation. Now that figure has gone up to about half. As population
increased over the centuries and the demand for food went up,
peasants extended the boundaries of cultivation, clearing forests and
breaking new land. In the colonial period, cultivation expanded
rapidly for a variety of reasons. First, the British directly encouraged

4.4 War and Deforestation
The First World War and the Second World War had a major impact
on forests. In India, working plans were abandoned at this time, and
the forest department cut trees freely to meet British war needs. In
Java, just before the Japanese occupied the region, the Dutch followed
‘a scorched earth’ policy, destroying sawmills, and burning huge
piles of giant teak logs so that they would not fall into Japanese
hands. The Japanese then exploited the forests recklessly for their
own war industries, forcing forest villagers to cut down forests.
Many villagers used this opportunity to expand cultivation in the
forest. After the war, it was difficult for the Indonesian forest service
to get this land back. As in India, people’s need for agricultural land
has brought them into conflict with the forest department’s desire
to control the land and exclude people from it.
4.5 New Developments in Forestry","has brought them into conflict with the forest department’s desire
to control the land and exclude people from it.
4.5 New Developments in Forestry
Since the 1980s, governments across Asia and Africa have begun to
see that scientific forestry and the policy of keeping forest
communities  away from forests has resulted in many conflicts.
Conservation of forests rather than collecting timber has become a
more important goal. The government has recognised that in order
to meet this goal, the people who live near the forests must be
involved. In many cases, across India, from Mizoram to Kerala, dense
forests have survived only because villages protected them in sacred
groves known as sarnas, devarakudu, kan, rai,  etc. Some villag es have
been patrolling their own forests, with each household taking it in
turns, instead of leaving it to the forest guards. Local forest
communities and environmentalists today are thinking of different
forms of forest management."
How did British policies affect Indian pastoralists?,"According to the context, British policies affected Indian pastoralists by:

* Taking over grazing lands and turning them into cultivated fields, leading to a serious shortage of pastures.
* Reserving forests, which meant that shepherds and cattle herders could no longer freely pasture their cattle in the forests.
* Imposing restrictions on pastoral movements, causing continuous intensive grazing of pastures, leading to a decline in pasture quality and creating a further shortage of forage for animals.","British policies led to a shortage of pastures for Indian pastoralists. Grazing lands were converted into cultivated fields and forests were reserved, restricting access for shepherds and cattle herders. Restrictions on movement led to continuous, intensive grazing, which declined the quality of pastures and animal stock.

most viable form of life.
Such changes were not  experienced only  by pastoral communities
in India. In many other parts of the world, new laws and settlement
patterns forced pastoral communities to alter their lives. How did
pastoral communities elsewhere cope with these changes in the
modern world?

2.1 How Did these Changes Affect the Lives of Pastoralists?
These measures led to a serious shortage of pastures. When grazing
lands were taken over and turned into cultivated fields, the available
area of pastureland declined. Similarly, the reservation of forests
meant that shepherds and cattle herders could no longer freely pasture
their cattle in the forests.
As pasturelands disappeared under the plough, the existing animal
stock had to feed on whatever grazing land remained. This led to
continuous intensive grazing of these pastures. Usually nomadic
pastoralists grazed their animals in one area and moved to another
area. These pastoral movements allowed time for the natural
restoration of vegetation growth. When restrictions were imposed
on pastoral movements, grazing lands came to be continuously used
and the quality of patures declined.  This in turn created a further
shortage of forage for animals and the deterioration of animal stock."
What are natural disasters?,"Based on the context, natural disasters are events caused by oceans, such as:

* Storms with extreme rainfall or strong winds (e.g., cyclones)
* Tsunamis (powerful waves caused by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions)
* Avalanches (sudden fall of snow, ice, or rocks from a mountainside)
* Landslides (sudden collapse of earth or rock from a mountainside)
* Flash floods (sudden local floods often caused by cloudbursts)

These events can cause widespread damage and loss of life.","Natural disasters are violent events with extreme rainfall or very strong winds, such as cyclones, which can cause widespread damage to coastal regions. A tsunami, a huge and powerful wave generally caused by a strong earthquake or a volcanic eruption at the bottom of the ocean, is another natural disaster.

What was the impact of the Forest Acts on pastoralists?,"According to the context, the Forest Acts had a significant impact on pastoralists. They were:

* Prevented from entering many forests that previously provided valuable forage for their cattle.
* Allowed entry into some forests, but with severe restrictions on their movements.
* Required to obtain a permit for entry and had limited time spent in the forest (specified by the permit).
* Liable to fines if they overstayed the permitted period.

These changes restricted the freedom of pastoralists to roam and graze their cattle, affecting their livelihoods.","The Forest Acts significantly impacted pastoralists by:

*   Preventing them from accessing many forests previously used for grazing.
*   Regulating their movements, even in allowed areas, requiring permits with specified entry/departure times and limited durations.
*   Restricting their ability to stay in an area with ample forage due to permit regulations.
*   Subjecting them to fines for overstaying permit periods.
","some forests which produced commercially valuable timber like
deodar or sal were declared ‘Reserved’. No pastoralist was allowed
access to these forests. Other forests were classified as ‘Protected’.
In these, some customary  grazing rights of pastoralists were
granted but their movements were severely restricted. The
colonial officials believed that grazing destroyed the saplings and
young shoots of trees that germinated on the forest floor. The
herds trampled over the saplings and munched away the shoots.
This prevented new trees from growing.
These Forest Acts changed the lives of pastoralists. They were
now prevented from entering many forests that had earlier
provided valuable forage for their cattle. Even in the areas they

Department permits that had been issued to them now ruled their

distrusted mobile craftsmen and traders who hawked their goods
in villages, and pastoralists who changed their places of residence

the shifting cultivators and food gatherers often seem to be stuck in the past. It is as

Land and the People
This first theme includes the basics of the geographical 
world around us — some of the main features of our planet 
and the way to represent them on a map. Why is this 
theme important, when today we can get excellent maps 
on a mobile phone? Because it deals with much more than 
maps. It also asks how geographical features — oceans, 
mountains, rivers, etc. — have shaped entire civilisations 
throughout their histories. It is also, in India’s case, about 
how its natural setting has contributed to giving this ancient 
civilisation a unique identity.
Theme B – Tapestry of the Past
A tapestry is a large piece of canvas-like cloth usually 
kept as a wall hanging, with pictures and designs on it — 
sometimes a historical narrative. Our tapestry is where 
we will be painting scenes from the past, beginning with 
India’s past. But why should we be at all concerned with the 
past? Because it is the key to understanding the present, and","materials (such as stone or metal) and the production

How Important are Dates?
There was a time when historians were 
fascinated with dates. There were heated 
debates about the dates on which rulers 
were crowned or battles were fought. In 
the common-sense notion, history was 
synonymous with dates. You may have 
heard people say, “I find history boring 
because it is all about memorising 
dates.” Is such a conception true?
History is certainly about changes 
that occur over time. It is about 
finding out how things were in the 
past and how things have changed. 
As soon as we compare the past with 
the present, we refer to time, we talk of 
“before” and “after”. 
Living in the world we do not always 
ask historical questions about what 
we see around us. We take things for 
granted, as if what we see has always 
been in the world we inhabit. But most of 
us have our moments of wonder, when we are 
curious, and we ask questions that actually are historical.","59

From Village to City
The vast plains of the Punjab (today 
divided between India and Pakistan) and 
Sindh (now in Pakistan) are watered by 
the Indus River and its tributaries. This 
made those plains fertile and, therefore, 
favourable to agriculture. A little further 
east, a few millenniums ago, another 
river , the Sarasvatī, used to flow from 
the foothills of the Himalayas through 
Haryana, Punjab, parts of Rajasthan 
and Gujarat (see Fig. 6.3). In this whole 
region, from about 3500 BCE, villages 
grew into towns, and with increasing 
trade and other exchanges, those towns 
further grew into cities. This transition 
happened around 2600 BCE. 
Archaeologists gave this civilisation 
several names — ‘Indus’, ‘Harappan’, 
‘Indus-Sarasvatī’ or ‘Sindhu-Sarasvatī’

Its inhabitants are called ‘Harappans’.

along. When historians study, say, a king or queen of 1,500 
years ago, an ancient monument, a war or some items of 
trade, they take great care to gather information from as 
many sources as they can find and consult. Sometimes, the 
sources confirm each other (the jigsaw pieces match); at 
other times, sources may give contradictory information 
(the jigsaw pieces don’t match), in which case they need to 
decide which source they can trust more. That is how they 
try to re-create the history of the period they are studying.

planet Earth. Landforms take shape over millions of years 
and have a significant connection with the environment 
and life. They can broadly be divided into three categories 
— mountains, plateaus and plains (Fig. 3.1). 
These landforms have different climates and are home to 
a variety of flora and fauna. Humans have adapted to all 
landforms, but the number of people living on different 
kinds of landforms varies throughout the world. 
Mountains 
Mountains are landforms that are much higher than the 
surrounding landscape. They can be recognised by a broad 
base, steep slopes and a narrow summit. Depending on 
their height, some mountains are covered with snow. At 
lower altitudes, the snow melts every summer and turns

How does climate influence the culture and economy of a region?,"Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that climate influences culture and economy of a region in the following way:

The climate becomes more moderate as you travel away from the Equator towards one of the two poles. This information suggests that different climates can exist in different regions, which may shape the cultural practices and economic activities of those regions.

THE MAKING OF 
REGIONAL CULTURES
O
ne of the commonest ways of describing people  
is in terms of the language they speak. When we 
refer to a person as a Tamil or an Oriya, this usually 
means that he or she speaks Tamil or Oriya and lives 
in Tamil Nadu or Orissa. We also tend to associate 
each region with distinctive kinds of food, clothes, 
poetry, dance, music and painting. Sometimes we take 
these identities for granted and assume that they have 
existed from time immemorial. However, the frontiers 
separating regions have evolved over time (and in 
fact are still changing). Also, what we understand 
as regional cultures today are often the product of 
complex processes of intermixing of local traditions 
with ideas from other parts of the subcontinent. As 
regions, others seem to be similar across regions, and","the Equator , the climate is generally hot (it is also called 
‘torrid’). As you travel away from the Equator towards one

closer to the North or South Pole, the climate grows colder 
(or ‘frigid’). You will learn in Science why this is so, and

Why is the Equator considered an important geographical marker?,"According to the context, the Equator is considered an important geographical marker because it serves as a fixed point halfway between the North Pole and South Pole on the globe. It is also the reference point for measuring latitude, with latitudes expressed in degrees and the Equator being zero degree (0°).","The Equator is an important geographical marker because it is halfway between the North and South Poles and is used as the 0° latitude line to measure distance from it.

The system used in these two examples may be called a 
system of coordinates. Thanks to their two coordinates, 
the stationery shop as well as the chess square on the 
chessboard can be precisely determined.
A similar system of coordinates is used in the world of maps 
to determine the location of any place on a map. Let us see 
how this system works.
b) Latitudes
Let us return to the globe. It is easy to identify the North 
Pole and the South Pole on it. Rotate the globe; while it 
rotates, the fixed points at the top and bottom are the two 
poles. Halfway between them is the Equator; note the circle 
marking it (see Fig. 1.3). 
Imagine that you stand on the Equator and travel towards 
one of the poles; your distance from the Equator increases. 
Latitude measures this distance from the Equator . At any 
point of this travel, you can draw an imaginary line that","15

c) Longitudes
Imagine now that you travel from the North Pole to the South 
Pole by the shortest possible line. Observe the globe: you 
will see that instead of passing through Europe and Africa, 
you could just as well pass through Asia — the distance 
would be the same. These lines are called meridians of 
longitude (Fig. 1.3). They are all half-circles running from 
one pole to the other .
You will also learn in Science that the Earth spins on its 
axis. To put it simply, let’s place a desk lamp a little away 
from our globe, focused on it, and imagine that this is    
1-100724-v9.indd   151-100724-v9.indd   15 11-Jul-24   4:20:23 PM11-Jul-24   4:20:23 PM","one of the poles; your distance from the Equator increases. 
Latitude measures this distance from the Equator . At any 
point of this travel, you can draw an imaginary line that 
runs east and west, parallel to the Equator . Such a line is 
called a parallel of latitude and it draws a circle around 
the Earth. Again, it is easy to note on the globe that the 
largest circle is the Equator , while the circles marked by the 
parallels of latitude grow smaller as we move northward or 
southward (Fig. 1.3). 
Latitudes are expressed in degrees; by convention, the 
Equator is latitude 0° (zero degree), while the latitudes of 
the two poles are 90° North and 90° South respectively; this 
is noted 90°N and 90°S.
There is a connection between latitude and climate. Around 
the Equator , the climate is generally hot (it is also called 
‘torrid’). As you travel away from the Equator towards one 
of the two poles (in other words, as your latitude increases),"
What is the significance of latitude and longitude in geography?,"According to the context, the significance of latitude and longitude in geography is that they together form a system of coordinates that allows us to precisely locate any place on Earth. Latitude measures the distance from the Equator towards one of the poles, while longitude measures the distance from the Prime Meridian (0° longitude) along the Equator. This system enables us to determine the exact location of a place, such as Delhi lying at 29°N latitude and 77°E longitude.","Based on the text, the significance of latitude and longitude in geography is that they together form a system of coordinates that allows you to locate any place on Earth.

the Sun illuminating the Earth. Slowly rotating the globe 
eastward, we can note that for some places on the Earth it 
is morning, while for others it is mid-day, evening or night 
— when it’s breakfast time in one country, it’s lunchtime in 
another and in a third country people are fast asleep! That 
is why by measuring the longitude of a place, we will also 
be measuring the time at that place. Let us see how. 
To measure longitudes, we need to define a reference point 
called the Prime Meridian (Fig. 1.3 on page 15). It is also 
called Greenwich Meridian because, in the year 1884, 
some nations decided that the meridian passing through 
Greenwich, an area of London in England, would become 
the international standard for the Prime Meridian. It is 
marked as 0° longitude. 
Just as latitude is a measure of the distance from the 
Equator if you travel towards one of the poles, longitude is","marked as 0° longitude. 
Just as latitude is a measure of the distance from the 
Equator if you travel towards one of the poles, longitude is 
a measure of the distance from the Prime Meridian if you 
travel along the Equator . Longitude, too, is measured in 
degrees. Westward or eastward, it increases in value from 
0° to 180°, with the letter ‘W’ or ‘E’ added. For instance, 
using round figures, New York’s longitude is 74°W, while 
Delhi’s is 77°E and Tokyo’s is 140°E.
DON’T MISS OUT
As you can see on the globe of meridians of longitudes, 180°W 
and 180°E are the same longitude; so this longitude is noted 
180°, omitting the letter W or E. 
Latitude and longitude together are the two coordinates of 
a place. With them, you are now able to locate any place on 
Earth! You can now understand a statement such as “Delhi 
lies at 29°N latitude and 77°E longitude” (these values are 
rounded off, not exact).

How does the Earth’s rotation affect time zones?,"According to the context, the Earth's rotation affects time zones in that as the planet spins around its axis, the concept of local time changes with each meridian of longitude. Moving eastward from the Prime Meridian, every 15° marks an hour difference in local time. This is why countries like Russia and Canada have multiple time zones.","The Earth's rotation affects time zones because the Earth makes a full turn (360°) every 24 hours, which equals 15° per hour. As you move eastward from the Prime Meridian, you add one hour of local time with each 15° meridian, and going westward, you subtract one hour.

Understanding Time Zones
Let’s make the globe rotate again from west to east — 
that is how our planet spins around its axis, making a full 
turn every 24 hours. A full turn is 360°, so this means 15° 
per hour (15 x 24 = 360). Let us now mark the meridians 
of longitude every 15°. Moving eastward from the Prime 
Meridian, we get 0°, 15°E, 30°E, 45°E, and so on every 15° 
up to 180°E. It is the same as adding one hour of local time 
with each meridian — if it is 12 pm or noon at Greenwich, it 
is 1 pm local time at 15°E, 2 pm at 30°E, and so on. But going 
westward, it is the other way round — 11 am local time at 
15°W, 10 am at 30°W, etc.

has one standard time. That is not always the case. Some 
countries, like Russia, Canada or the USA, are too large to have

A Map and Its Components
From this simple example, we understand that a map is a 
representation, or a drawing, of some area — it may be a 
small area (a village, a town, etc.), a bigger area (say, your 
district or state), or a very large area like India or even the 
whole world. In a map, you look at the surface as if you are 
viewing it from the top.
An atlas is a book or collection of maps.
As you will discover , there are several kinds of maps —","different kinds of buildings (for instance a railway station, 
a school, a post office), for roads and railway lines, and for 
natural elements such as a river , a pond or a forest. In that 
way, numerous details can be shown in the limited space 
available on a map.
To make maps more easily understood by a variety of users, 
map makers use specific symbols. Different countries use 
different sets of symbols. The Survey of India, a government 
body, has fixed a set of symbols for maps of India (or parts 
of India). A small selection of them is shown in Fig. 1.2 on 
page 12.

How does geography influence the economic activities of a region?,"Based on the provided context, geography influences the economic activities of a region by affecting the types of industries that can thrive in an area. For example, the availability of fertile agricultural lands and irrigation systems can lead to the development of agriculture as an economic activity. Similarly, the presence of natural resources such as forests or fisheries can enable related industries like forestry or fishing. The context does not provide specific examples of how geography influences economic activities beyond these general observations.","Geography influences economic activities related to nature such as farming, fishing, and forestry.

How do natural disasters shape landforms over time?,"Based on the context, natural disasters shape landforms over time by causing geological events such as landslides, avalanches, and flash floods. These events can alter the landscape by changing the shape or structure of the land. For example, a landslide can cause erosion or deposition of soil and rocks, while an avalanche can reshape the mountainous terrain.","The provided context does not explicitly detail how natural disasters shape landforms over time. However, it mentions several natural disasters and their immediate effects:

*   **Cyclones:** Cause widespread damage to coastal regions.
*   **Tsunamis:** Submerge coastal areas, causing widespread damage.
*   **Avalanches & Landslides:** The sudden fall of snow, ice or rocks from a mountainside and the sudden collapse of a mass of earth or rock from a mountainside respectively.
*   **Flash floods:** A sudden local flood often caused by a cloudburst.

These events suggest that natural disasters contribute to the erosion and reshaping of existing landforms, particularly in coastal and mountainous regions.

 Æ In the same groups, discuss a journey that any of you 
has made through a region of India. List the different 
landscapes seen on the way. Compare with other groups.
A landform is a physical feature on the surface of our  
planet Earth. Landforms take shape over millions of years 
and have a significant connection with the environment 
and life. They can broadly be divided into three categories 
— mountains, plateaus and plains (Fig. 3.1). 
These landforms have different climates and are home to 
a variety of flora and fauna. Humans have adapted to all 
landforms, but the number of people living on different 
kinds of landforms varies throughout the world. 
Mountains 
Mountains are landforms that are much higher than the 
surrounding landscape. They can be recognised by a broad 
base, steep slopes and a narrow summit. Depending on 
their height, some mountains are covered with snow. At 
lower altitudes, the snow melts every summer and turns

large masses of clouds. Such clouds 
bring rain to the continents; for

in India expect every summer 
originate in the ocean — without 
such rains, our agriculture and all life will suffer . But oceans 
often also give rise to storms — violent events with extreme 
rainfall or very strong winds, such as cyclones, which can 
cause widespread damage to coastal regions of the world. 
A tsunami is another natural disaster that originates in the 
ocean. It is a huge and powerful wave generally caused by 
a strong earthquake or a volcanic eruption at the bottom 
of the ocean. Tsunamis can travel thousands of kilometres 
and submerge coastal areas, causing widespread damage.

The Greenwich Meridian is not the first prime meridian. 
There were others in the past. In fact, many centuries before 
Europe, India had a prime meridian of its own! (Fig. 1.5) It 
was called madhya rekhā (or ‘middle line’) and passed through 
the city of Ujjayinī (today Ujjain), which was a reputed centre 
for astronomy over many centuries. Varāhamihira, a famous 
astronomer , lived and worked there some 1,500 years ago.","16 Exploring Society: India and Beyond

eastward, we can note that for some places on the Earth it 
is morning, while for others it is mid-day, evening or night 
— when it’s breakfast time in one country, it’s lunchtime in 
another and in a third country people are fast asleep! That 
is why by measuring the longitude of a place, we will also 
be measuring the time at that place. Let us see how. 
To measure longitudes, we need to define a reference point 
called the Prime Meridian (Fig. 1.3 on page 15). It is also 
called Greenwich Meridian because, in the year 1884, 
some nations decided that the meridian passing through 
Greenwich, an area of London in England, would become 
the international standard for the Prime Meridian. It is 
marked as 0° longitude.

Equator if you travel towards one of the poles, longitude is","15

Imagine now that you travel from the North Pole to the South 
Pole by the shortest possible line. Observe the globe: you

you could just as well pass through Asia — the distance

longitude (Fig. 1.3). They are all half-circles running from 
one pole to the other .
You will also learn in Science that the Earth spins on its 
axis. To put it simply, let’s place a desk lamp a little away 
from our globe, focused on it, and imagine that this is

How does the International Date Line affect time and date changes?,"According to the context, crossing the International Date Line by ship or plane requires changing the date on your watch. When traveling eastward, you subtract a day (e.g., Monday becomes Sunday), and when traveling westward, you add a day (e.g., Sunday becomes Monday).","The International Date Line, located at approximately 180° longitude, marks where the +12 and -12 time zones meet. When crossing the International Date Line eastward, you subtract a day. When crossing it westward, you add a day. The line deviates in places to avoid dividing countries into two different days.

you need to change the date in your watch. If you cross it

DON’T MISS OUT 
From the above explanation, it may seem as if every country 
has one standard time. That is not always the case. Some 
countries, like Russia, Canada or the USA, are too large to have 
a single time zone. The USA has six time zones and Russia has 
11 — which means that travelling across Russia from east to 
west, you will need to readjust your watch 10 times to align 
with the local time!
Similarly, the globe in Fig. 1.9, centred on India, shows 
standard times with respect to GMT for a few countries. 
Finally, while the Prime Meridian was fixed at Greenwich, 
the opposite line — at approximately 180° longitude — is 
called the International Date Line.

in places to avoid dividing some countries into two different 
days!

","produce. It was seen as ‘waste land’ that needed to be brought
under cultivation. From the mid-nineteenth century, Waste Land
Rules were enacted in various parts of the country. By these Rules
uncultivated lands were taken over and given to select individuals.
These individuals were granted various concessions and encouraged
to settle these lands. Some of them were made headmen of villages
in the newly cleared areas. In most areas the lands taken over
were actually grazing tracts used regularly by pastoralists. So
expansion of cultivation inevitably meant the decline of pastures
and a problem for pastoralists.
Second, by the mid-nineteenth century, various Forest Acts were
also being enacted in the different provinces.  Through these Acts
some forests which produced commercially valuable timber like
deodar or sal were declared ‘Reserved’. No pastoralist was allowed
access to these forests. Other forests were classified as ‘Protected’.","India and the Contemporary World

Source CUnder colonial rule, the life of pastoralists changed dramatically.
Their grazing grounds shrank, their movements were regulated,
and the revenue they had to pay increased. Their agricultural stock
declined and their trades and crafts were adversely affected. How?
First, the colonial state wanted to transform all grazing lands
into cultivated farms. Land revenue was one of the main sources
of its finance. By expanding cultivation it could increase its revenue
collection. It could at the same time produce more jute, cotton,
wheat and other agricultural produce that were required in
England. To colonial officials all uncultivated land appeared to
be unproductive: it produced neither revenue nor agricultural
produce. It was seen as ‘waste land’ that needed to be brought
under cultivation. From the mid-nineteenth century, Waste Land
Rules were enacted in various parts of the country. By these Rules","India and the Contemporary World

2.1 How Did these Changes Affect the Lives of Pastoralists?
These measures led to a serious shortage of pastures. When grazing
lands were taken over and turned into cultivated fields, the available
area of pastureland declined. Similarly, the reservation of forests
meant that shepherds and cattle herders could no longer freely pasture
their cattle in the forests.
As pasturelands disappeared under the plough, the existing animal
stock had to feed on whatever grazing land remained. This led to
continuous intensive grazing of these pastures. Usually nomadic
pastoralists grazed their animals in one area and moved to another
area. These pastoral movements allowed time for the natural
restoration of vegetation growth. When restrictions were imposed
on pastoral movements, grazing lands came to be continuously used
and the quality of patures declined.  This in turn created a further
shortage of forage for animals and the deterioration of animal stock."
How do climate zones affect agriculture in different parts of the world?,"According to the context, climate zones affect agriculture in different parts of the world by influencing the type of crops grown. For example, in central India and Africa, millets are grown, while in Brazil, manioc is grown, and in other parts of Latin America, maize and beans are grown.

However, it does not explicitly explain how different climate zones affect agriculture. It only mentions that a mixture of crops is grown on these plots like millets in central India and Africa, manioc in Brazil, and maize and beans in other parts of Latin America.

India, dhya, penda, bewar, nevad, jhum , podu, khandad and  kumri

In shifting cultivation, parts of the forest are cut and burnt in rotation.
Seeds are sown in the ashes after the first monsoon rains, and the crop is
harvested by October-November. Such plots are cultivated for a couple
of years and then left fallow for 12 to 18 years for the forest to grow
back. A mixture of crops is grown on these plots. In central India
and Africa it could be millets, in Brazil manioc, and in other parts of
Latin America maize and beans.
European foresters regarded this practice as harmful for the forests. They
felt that land which was used for cultivation every few years could not
grow trees for railway timber. When a forest was burnt, there was
the added danger of the flames spreading and burning valuable timber.

from the forests, and if they were caught, they were at the mercy of

police constables and forest guards to harass people by demanding

How Important are Dates?
There was a time when historians were 
fascinated with dates. There were heated 
debates about the dates on which rulers 
were crowned or battles were fought. In 
the common-sense notion, history was 
synonymous with dates. You may have 
heard people say, “I find history boring 
because it is all about memorising 
dates.” Is such a conception true?
History is certainly about changes 
that occur over time. It is about 
finding out how things were in the 
past and how things have changed. 
As soon as we compare the past with 
the present, we refer to time, we talk of 
“before” and “after”. 
Living in the world we do not always 
ask historical questions about what 
we see around us. We take things for 
granted, as if what we see has always 
been in the world we inhabit. But most of 
us have our moments of wonder, when we are 
curious, and we ask questions that actually are historical.","history in fact acquires a new meaning. It allows us to see everyday things from
a different angle. We realise that even seemingly ordinary things have a history
that is important for us to know.
To know how the contemporary world has evolved we will therefore move
from India to Africa, from Europe to Indonesia. We will read both about the
big events and important ideas, as well as everyday life. In the process of these
journeys you will discover how history can be exciting, how it can help us
understand the world in which we live.

remember them all now; we will use some of them as we go 
along. When historians study, say, a king or queen of 1,500 
years ago, an ancient monument, a war or some items of 
trade, they take great care to gather information from as 
many sources as they can find and consult. Sometimes, the 
sources confirm each other (the jigsaw pieces match); at 
other times, sources may give contradictory information 
(the jigsaw pieces don’t match), in which case they need to 
decide which source they can trust more. That is how they 
try to re-create the history of the period they are studying.
Who contributes to all these sources of history? Historians 
themselves, but also archaeologists, epigraphists (who 
study ancient inscriptions), anthropologists (who study 
human societies and their cultures), experts in literature

along. When historians study, say, a king or queen of 1,500 
years ago, an ancient monument, a war or some items of 
trade, they take great care to gather information from as 
many sources as they can find and consult. Sometimes, the 
sources confirm each other (the jigsaw pieces match); at

CHAPTER6 
The most ancient civilisation of India, known variously as the 
Harappan, Indus or Indus-Sarasvatī Civilisation, was indeed 
remarkable in many ways. ... [It showed how] a well-balanced 
community lives — in which the differences between the rich

societal scenario was not that of ‘exploitation’, but of mutual 
‘accommodation’.

For each characteristic in the list above, can you make a list  of 
professions or occupations that might exist in such a society? 
It is easy enough to see that all these characteristics are 
present in most societies in the world today. But when did 
civilisation begin, in the sense we have now defined? 
Civilisation began at different times in different parts of the 
world. In the region known as Mesopotamia (modern Iraq 
and Syria), that happened about 6,000 years ago, and the 
civilisation in ancient Egypt followed a few centuries later . 
You will learn about these and a few more civilisations in a 
later grade. In many ways, humanity would not have reached 
its present stage without the enormous contributions and 
advances of those ancient civilisations.

ou saw in Chapters 2, 3 and 4 how kingdoms  
rose and fell. Even as this was happening, new arts, 
and villages. Over the centuries important political, 
social and economic developments had taken place. 
But social change was not the same everywhere, 
because different kinds of societies evolved 
differently. It is important to understand 
how and why this happened.
In large parts of the subcontinent, society 
was already divided according to the rules 
of . These rules, as prescribed by the 
Brahmanas, were accepted by the rulers 
of large kingdoms. The difference between 
the high and low, and between the rich and 
poor, increased. Under the Delhi Sultans 
and the Mughals, this hierarchy between 
social classes grew further. 
Beyond Big Cities: Tribal 
Societies 
There were, however, other kinds of 
societies as well. Many societies in the 
subcontinent did not follow the social rules 
and rituals prescribed by the Brahmanas."
How did trade influence ancient Indian society?,"According to the context, trade influenced ancient Indian society by introducing traders and moneylenders who came into forests, buying forest produce, offering cash loans, and asking tribal groups to work for wages. This led to changes in the lives of tribal groups, including an increase in market demand for their goods and services, and exposure to European colonizers and global systems.","Trade influenced ancient Indian society by bringing traders and moneylenders into forests to buy produce, offer loans, and employ tribal groups. This increased market demand for their goods and exposed them to European colonizers and global systems.

Many tribal groups reacted against the 
colonial forest laws. They disobeyed the 
new rules, continued with practices that 
were declared illegal, and at times rose 
in open rebellion. Such was the revolt of 
Songram Sangma in 1906  in Assam, and 
the forest satyagraha of the 1930s in the 
Central Provinces.
The problem with trade
During the nineteenth century, tribal 
groups found that traders and money-
lenders were coming into the forests more 
often, wanting to buy forest produce, 
offering cash loans, and asking them to 
work for wages. It took tribal groups some 
time to understand the consequences of 
what was happening.
Let us consider the case of the silk 
growers. In the eighteenth century, Indian 
silk was in demand in European markets. 
The fine quality of Indian silk was highly 
valued and exports from India increased 
rapidly. As the market expanded, East India Company","capital. Large plantations could borrow it from banks and

many groups of bankers and traders who financed export
agriculture in Central and Southeast Asia, using either their own
funds or those borrowed from European banks. They had a
sophisticated system to transfer money over large distances, and
even developed indigenous forms of corporate organisation.
Indian traders and moneylenders also followed European
colonisers into Africa. Hyderabadi Sindhi traders, however,
ventured beyond European colonies. From the 1860s they
established flourishing emporia at busy ports worldwide, selling
local and imported curios to tourists whose numbers were
beginning to swell, thanks to the d evelopment of safe and

Why is cultural exchange significant in history?,"According to the provided context, cultural exchange is significant in history because it has been a continuous process of interlinking human societies since ancient times.

This exchange has played a crucial role in shaping the world we live in today.","According to the provided text, cultural exchange is significant in history because throughout history, travelers, traders, priests, and pilgrims carried values, skills, ideas, and inventions across vast distances.

The  Making  of  a  Global  World
1  The Pre-modern World
When we talk of ‘globalisation’ we often refer to an economic
system that has emerged since the last 50 years or so. But as you will
see in this chapter, the making of the global world has a long
history – of trade, of migration, of people in search of work, the
movement of capital, and much else. As we think about the dramatic
and visible signs of global interconnectedness in our lives today,
we need to understand the phases through which this world in
which we live has emerged.
All through history, human societies have become steadily more
interlinked. From ancient times, travellers, traders, priests and
pilgrims travelled vast distances for knowledge, opportunity and
spiritual fulfilment, or to escape persecution. They carried goods,
money
, values, skills, ideas, inventions, and even germs and diseases.
As early as 3000 BCE an active coastal trade linked the Indus valley","57
The  Making  of  a  Global  World
The world changed profoundly in the nineteenth century. Economic,
political, social, cultural and technological factors interacted in
complex ways to transform societies and reshape external relations.
Economists identify three types of movement or ‘flows’ within
international economic exchanges. 
The first is the flow of trade which
in the nineteenth century referred largely to trade in goods (e.g.,
cloth or wheat). The second is the flow of labour – the migration
of people in search of employment. The third is the movement of
capital for short-term or long-term investments over long distances.
All three flows were closely interwoven and affected peoples’ lives
more deeply now than ever before. The interconnections could
sometimes be broken – for example, labour migration was often
more restricted than goods or capital flows. Yet it helps us understand
the nineteenth-century world economy better if we look at the
three flows together.","also explains the presence of ‘Big Questions’ at the start of 
each chapter in this book.
You may also be intrigued to find a game of chess and 
some ancient Tamil poetry in chapters that apparently deal 
with geography; a discussion on the uses of the sari in a 
chapter on cultural heritage; the concept of sevā and the 
mention of festivals in chapters focusing on economics. 
This is deliberate. We believe in bringing elements from 
diverse fields together (you will learn later that this is 
called ‘multidisciplinarity’). This enriches our perspective. 
Indeed, life constantly mixes numerous elements together , 
so why should we not?
By now, it should be clear that although Social Science 
makes constant use of the past, it seeks to make sense of 
the present so as to help us prepare a better future. It is an 
exploration and an adventure.

What role did rivers play in the development of early civilizations?,"According to the context, rivers played a crucial role in the development of early civilizations. Rivers facilitated economic activities such as agriculture and trade, supported travel between places, and had cultural significance, with many communities considering a river's source or confluence as sacred. In particular, the Ganga River in India has been extensively used for navigation, agriculture, and fishing, with rice being a major crop grown in its fertile plains.","Rivers played a significant role in the development of early civilizations by:

*   **Supporting economic activities:** River navigation was easy and supported many economic activities.
*   **Facilitating travel:** People used rivers to travel from one place to another.
*   **Enabling agriculture:** Rivers provided water and fertile soil for agriculture, particularly the cultivation of rice.
","Whether in mountain ranges or plains, rivers around the 
world have carried immense cultural value. In particular , 
many communities have considered a river’s source and 
its confluence with one or two other rivers to be sacred. 
In India, numerous festivals, ceremonies and rituals are 
conducted at such locations.
Because plains have a gentle slope, river navigation is easy 
and supports a lot of economic activities. In earlier days, 
people also used rivers extensively to travel from one place 
to another . Even today (Fig. 3.10 on page 56), there are 
stretches along the Ganga where people prefer to use boats  
to move around!

crops such as cotton, jute and hemp are also grown in the

decades, however , agriculture has turned to irrigation, 
with water brought to the fields through networks of 
canals or pumped from groundwater . While irrigation has 
increased agricultural production, it has also contributed to

How has India’s historical past shaped its present-day identity?,"Based on the provided context, India's historical past has shaped its present-day identity in the following ways:

* Indians began looking into their past to discover India's great achievements and take pride in them, which was a response to British colonization.
* Nationalist histories emerged that glorified ancient Indian achievements, such as art, architecture, science, mathematics, religion, culture, law, philosophy, crafts, and trade.
* These nationalist histories encouraged Indians to struggle for change under British rule.
* The past is still with us today, helping us understand who we are and where we come from.

Overall, India's historical past has played a significant role in shaping its present-day identity by promoting national pride and a sense of heritage.","India's historical past significantly shapes its present-day identity. The context highlights that the past is a major source of identity, helping Indians understand who they are and where they come from. During British rule, Indians looked to their past to rediscover India’s great achievements in art, architecture, science, mathematics, religion, culture, law, philosophy, crafts, and trade, fostering national pride and the struggle against British rule. The context also mentions the importance of understanding India's cultural foundations to address contemporary issues.
","As we live our life in the present and read about the happenings around the world in
newspapers, we do not usually pause to think about the longer history of these
events. We see change before our eyes, but do not always ask, why ar
e things changing?
Very often we do not even notice that things were not the same in the past. History
is about tracking these changes, understanding how and why they are taking place,
how the present world in which we live has evolved.
The focus of the history books of Classes IX and X is on the emergence of the contemporary
world. In earlier classes (VI – VIII) you have read about the history of India. In the next
two years (Classes IX and X) you will see how the story of India’s pasts is related to the
larger history of the world. We cannot understand what was happening within India unless
we see this connection. This is particularly true about a world in which economies and","nation, Indian history had to be thought about differently. The British
saw Indians as backward and primitive, incapable of governing
themselves. In response, Indians began looking into the past to
discover India’s great achievements. They wrote about the glorious
developments in ancient times when art and architecture, science
and mathematics, religion and culture, law and philosophy, crafts
and trade had f lourished. This glorious time, in their vie w, was
followed by a history of decline, when India was colonised. These
nationalist histories urged the readers to take pride in India’s great
achievements in the past and str uggle to c hange the miser able
conditions of life under British rule.
These efforts to unify people were not without problems. When the
past being glorified was Hindu, when the images celebrated were
drawn from Hindu iconography, then people of other communities
felt left out.

clear . The past is a major source for our identities — it 
helps us understand who we are and where we come from. 
The past is still with us, in other words. And since history is 
unfortunately not all about happy developments, it is useful 
to understand where people, governments or rulers went 
wrong, and why. Only then can we hope to avoid repeating 
those errors. 
Theme C – Our Cultural Heritage and

It has often been said that India has a rich and ancient 
culture. True, but what are its main characteristics? Its 
guiding principles? How has it manifested itself in India’s

Why do historians use timelines?,"According to the context, historians use timelines because it is a convenient tool to mark historical events and shows a sequence of dates and events covering any particular period. It helps in understanding the order in which events take place and can be used to see relationships between events, such as the birth of Buddha occurring before that of Jesus.","Historians use timelines as a convenient tool to mark events and show the sequence of dates and events covering a particular period.
","Why, then, do we continue to associate history with 
a string of dates? This association has a reason. There 
was a time when history was an account of battles and big 
events. It was about rulers and their policies. Historians 
wrote about the year a king was crowned, the year he 
married, the year he had a child, the year he fought a 
particular war, the year he died, and the year the next 
ruler succeeded to the throne. For events such as these, 
specific dates can be determined, and in histories such 
as these, debates about dates continue to be important. 
As you have seen in the history textbooks of the past 
two years, historians now write about a host of other 
issues, and other questions. They look at how people 
earned their livelihood, what they produced and ate, how 
cities developed and markets came up, how kingdoms 
were formed and new ideas spread, and how cultures 
and society changed.
Which dates?
By what criteria do we choose a set of dates as","2 OUR PASTS – III
All such historical questions refer us back to 
notions of time. But time does not have to be always 
precisely dated in terms of a particular year or a month. 
Sometimes it is actually incorrect to fix precise dates 
to processes that happen over a period of time. People 
in India did not begin drinking tea one fine day; they 
developed a taste for it over time. There can be no 
one clear date for a process such as this. Similarly, 
we cannot fix one single date on which British rule 
was established, or the national movement started, or 
changes took place within the economy and society. All 
these things happened over a stretch of time. We can 
only refer to a span of time, an approximate period over 
which particular changes became visible.

a string of dates? This association has a reason. There 
was a time when history was an account of battles and big","64 Exploring Society: India and Beyond

tool to mark such events, as it shows a sequence of dates

For more than two millenniums, these two epics have been 
translated or adapted into regional literatures in India 
and beyond. In addition, there are countless folk versions 
of them. A few years ago, a scholar conducted a survey in 
Tamil Nadu alone and counted “about a hundred versions 
[of the Mahābhārata] that have come down to us in folklore 
forms.” Imagine what the number might be for the whole 
of India!
In fact, many communities have their own versions of the 
Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhārata. They have also preserved 
legends connecting their own history with these epics. This 
is especially true of tribal communities in many parts of

* Developing bhakti values and ideals of love and heroism

These contributions helped preserve ancient Indian culture and heritage.","Ancient Indian scholars played a vital role in understanding and preserving Indian culture through various contributions.

civilisation, they felt, had attained its glory in the 
ancient past, but had subsequently declined. In order to 
understand India, it was necessary to discover the sacred 
and legal texts that were produced in the ancient period. 
For only those texts could reveal the real ideas and laws 
of the Hindus and Muslims, and only a new study of 
these texts could form the basis of future development  
in India.
So Jones and Colebrooke went about discovering  ancient 
texts, understanding their meaning, translating them, and 
making their findings known to others. This project, they 
believed, would not only help the British learn from Indian 
culture, but it would also help Indians rediscover their own 
heritage, and understand the lost glories of their past. In this 
process, the British would become the guardians of Indian 
culture as well as its masters.

and heroism as found in the Sangam literature (the

Understanding the evolution of the contemporary world reveals the historical significance of seemingly ordinary aspects of life.

How, When and Where

How Important are Dates?
There was a time when historians were 
fascinated with dates. There were heated 
debates about the dates on which rulers 
were crowned or battles were fought. In 
the common-sense notion, history was 
synonymous with dates. You may have 
heard people say, “I find history boring 
because it is all about memorising 
dates.” Is such a conception true?
History is certainly about changes 
that occur over time. It is about 
finding out how things were in the 
past and how things have changed. 
As soon as we compare the past with 
the present, we refer to time, we talk of 
“before” and “after”. 
Living in the world we do not always 
ask historical questions about what 
we see around us. We take things for 
granted, as if what we see has always 
been in the world we inhabit. But most of 
us have our moments of wonder, when we are 
curious, and we ask questions that actually are historical.","2 OUR PASTS – III
All such historical questions refer us back to 
notions of time. But time does not have to be always 
precisely dated in terms of a particular year or a month. 
Sometimes it is actually incorrect to fix precise dates 
to processes that happen over a period of time. People 
in India did not begin drinking tea one fine day; they 
developed a taste for it over time. There can be no 
one clear date for a process such as this. Similarly, 
we cannot fix one single date on which British rule 
was established, or the national movement started, or 
changes took place within the economy and society. All 
these things happened over a stretch of time. We can 
only refer to a span of time, an approximate period over 
which particular changes became visible.
Why, then, do we continue to associate history with 
a string of dates? This association has a reason. There 
was a time when history was an account of battles and big","history in fact acquires a new meaning. It allows us to see everyday things from
a different angle. We realise that even seemingly ordinary things have a history
that is important for us to know.
To know how the contemporary world has evolved we will therefore move
from India to Africa, from Europe to Indonesia. We will read both about the
big events and important ideas, as well as everyday life. In the process of these
journeys you will discover how history can be exciting, how it can help us
understand the world in which we live.

How did India’s historical trade routes influence globalization?,"According to the context, India's historical trade routes influenced globalization by establishing connections with other parts of the world, such as Europe and Asia. The ancient Silk Road and other trade routes facilitated the exchange of goods like spices, textiles, and opium between India and other countries. This early globalization laid the groundwork for later economic interactions, including the rise of European colonial powers like Britain, which exploited these existing trade networks to their advantage.","Based on the provided text, India's historical trade routes influenced globalization in the following ways:

*   **Textile Dominance:** Before industrialization, India dominated the international textile market with its silk and cotton goods, especially finer varieties.
*   **Trade Connections:** Trade routes connected India to various regions, including Afghanistan, Persia, Central Asia, the Gulf, and the Red Sea Ports. Surat connected India to the Gulf and Red Sea Ports, while Masulipatam and Hoogly had trade links with Southeast Asia.
*   **Demand for Indian Goods:** Indian goods such as cotton, silk, pepper, cloves, cardamom, and cinnamon were in high demand in Europe.
*   **Opium Trade:** Opium shipments from India to China became India's single largest export for a time. This trade financed Britain's tea and other imports from China.
*   **Multilateral Settlement System:** Britain used its trade surplus with India to balance its trade deficits with other countries.

many decades. And, as you have read last year, opium shipments to
China grew rapidly from the 1820s to become for a while India’s
single largest export. Britain grew opium in India and exported it to
China and, with the money earned through this sale, it financed its
tea and other imports from China.
Over the nineteenth century, British manufactures flooded the Indian
market. Food grain and raw material exports from India to Britain
and the rest of the world increased. But the value of British exports
to India was much higher than the value of British imports from
India. Thus Britain had a ‘trade surplus’ with India. Britain used this
surplus to balance its trade deficits with other countries – that is,
with countries from which Britain was importing more than it was
selling to. This is how a multilateral settlement system works – it","By the time the first English ships sailed down the 
west coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and 
crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already 
established their presence in the western coast of India, 
and had their base in Goa. In fact, it was Vasco da 
Gama, a Portuguese explorer, who had discovered this 
sea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth 
century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities 
of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders 
arrived on the scene. 
The problem was that all the companies were 
interested in buying the same things. The fine qualities 
of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market 
in Europe. Pepper, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon 
too were in great demand. Competition amongst the 
European companies inevitably pushed up the prices 
at which these goods could be purchased, and this 
reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way 
the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating","89

3.1 The Age of Indian Textiles
Before the age of machine industries, silk and cotton goods from
India dominated the international market in textiles. Coarser cottons
were produced in many countries, but the finer varieties often came
from India. Armenian and Persian merchants took the goods from
Punjab to Afghanistan, eastern Persia and Central Asia.  Bales of fine
textiles were carried on camel back via the north-west frontier, through
mountain passes and across deserts. A vibr

through the main pr

and express this unity, or the ‘Many in the One’? To answer 
this question, we will explore a few dimensions of Indian life.

The anthropologist K.S. Singh directed 
the ‘People of India’ project we referred 
to earlier (see page 126). In the case of 
the Mahābhārata, he observed, “There 
is hardly a place in the country which 
the epic heroes such as the Pandavas, did not visit according 
to folklores.” And the same may be said of the Rāmāyaṇa. 
Over the centuries, perhaps more than any other texts, 
these two epics created a dense web of cultural interactions 
across India and many parts of Asia. Another example of 
unity in diversity.
To further illustrate the theme of this chapter , we could 
have continued our journey and turned to more facets 
of Indian culture. For instance, in India’s classical arts, 
including classical architecture, both diversity and unity 
are easily noticeable. (You will study these fields through 
the Art Curricular Area.)  
In the end, we should remember that Indian culture

How did India’s past rulers contribute to its governance structures?,"According to the context, India's past rulers contributed to its governance structures in the following ways:

* Mughal rulers: After Aurangzeb's death, many Mughal governors and big zamindars began asserting their authority and establishing regional kingdoms. This led to a decentralization of power and loss of effective control from Delhi.
* Maratha kingdoms: They were located mainly in the western part of India.

changes that were introduced by 
the British. 
1. The British Parliament passed 
a new Act in 1858 and transferred the 
powers of the East India Company to 
the British Crown in  order to ensure 
a more responsible management 
of Indian affairs. A member of the 
British Cabinet was appointed Secretary of State for 
India and made responsible for all matters related to the 
governance of India. He was given a council to advise 
him, called the India Council. The Governor-General of 
India was given the title of Viceroy, that is, a personal 
representative of the Crown. Through these measures,","From Trade to Territory

Aurangzeb was the last of the powerful Mughal rulers. He 
established control over a very large part of the territory 
that is now known as India. After his death in 1707, 
many Mughal governors (subadars) and big zamindars 
began asserting their authority and establishing regional 
kingdoms. As powerful regional kingdoms emerged in 
various parts of India, Delhi could no longer function as 
an effective centre.
By the second half of the eighteenth century, 
however, a new power was emerging on the political 
horizon – the British. Did you know that the British 
originally came as a small trading company and were 
reluctant to acquire territories? How then did they come 
to be masters of a vast empire? In this chapter you will 
see how this came about.

This long interaction has led to mutual enrichment, with Hinduism being influenced by tribal religions, and vice versa.","The provided context suggests that religion in India has historically been characterized by interaction and mutual influence between various groups, including caste-based society, tribal religions, and Hinduism.

This is also the case of the god Khandoba in parts of central 
India. In eastern India, the Munda and Santhal tribals, among 
others, worship Singbonga, a supreme deity who created this 
whole world. There are many more such examples.
The Indian sociologist André Béteille summed up this 
situation in these words:
“The thousands of castes and tribes on the Indian 
subcontinent have influenced each other in their 
religious beliefs and practices since the beginning of 
history and before. That the tribal religions have been 
influenced by Hinduism is widely accepted, but it is 
equally true that Hinduism, not only in its formative 
phase but throughout its evolution, has been influenced 
by tribal religions.”

this, it was necessary to introduce European manners, arts, 
institutions and laws in India. Mill, in fact, suggested that the 
British should conquer all the territories in India to ensure 
the enlightenment and happiness of the Indian people. For 
India was not capable of progress without British help.
In this idea of history, British rule represented all the forces 
of progress and civilisation. The period before British rule was 
one of darkness. Can such a conception be accepted today?
In any case, can we refer to any period of history as “Hindu” 
or “Muslim”? Did not a variety of faiths exist simultaneously 
in these periods? Why should we characterise an age only 
through the religion of the rulers of the time? To do so is to 
suggest that the lives and practices of the others do not really 
matter. We should also remember that even rulers in ancient 
India did not all share the same faith.

What were the causes and consequences of major historical conflicts in India?,"Based on the context provided, here are some major historical conflicts in India and their causes and consequences:

1. Mughal Empire's decline: The empire declined due to factors such as Emperor Aurangzeb depleting military and financial resources by fighting a long war in the Deccan. This led to internal strife and external threats from new political groups.
2. Conquest of eastern India: The British East India Company conquered major chunks of territory in eastern India, leading to conflicts with existing kingdoms and empires.

No specific information is provided on the causes and consequences of these conflicts, but it can be inferred that the Mughal Empire's decline led to power vacuum which was filled by new political groups like the British. The British conquests led to changes in the territories they conquered and immense fortunes for officials.","Based on the provided text, here's an analysis of the causes and consequences of major historical conflicts in India, specifically in the context of adopting Hinduism:

A Rich Diversity
If you travel through India by train, you will notice not 
only changing landscapes but also many different types of  
dresses and food; you will hear different languages, familiar 
and unfamiliar , and see different scripts on the way. Even 
within your own region, you will often come across people 
from other parts of India with different customs and 
traditions. This is India’s rich diversity, and it is usually the 
first thing that strikes visitors to our country.
With over 1.4 billion inhabitants (about 18 percent of the 
world’s population), such diversity is not surprising! In the 
late 20th century, the Anthropological Survey of India, a 
national organisation, conducted a massive survey called 
‘People of India project’ of 4,635 communities across all 
States of the country. It counted 325 languages using 25

or Harappan or Sindhu-Sarasvatī civilisation (which we 
visit in Chapter 6). Later on, over time, hundreds of schools 
of thought emerged in India. We will see here a few early","ancient cultures, both of India and the West. Indian 
civilisation, they felt, had attained its glory in the 
ancient past, but had subsequently declined. In order to 
understand India, it was necessary to discover the sacred 
and legal texts that were produced in the ancient period. 
For only those texts could reveal the real ideas and laws 
of the Hindus and Muslims, and only a new study of 
these texts could form the basis of future development  
in India.
So Jones and Colebrooke went about discovering  ancient 
texts, understanding their meaning, translating them, and 
making their findings known to others. This project, they 
believed, would not only help the British learn from Indian 
culture, but it would also help Indians rediscover their own 
heritage, and understand the lost glories of their past. In this 
process, the British would become the guardians of Indian 
culture as well as its masters. 
Influenced by such ideas, many Company officials"

are easily noticeable. (You will study these fields through

saw Indians as backward and primitive, incapable of governing
themselves. In response, Indians began looking into the past to
discover India’s great achievements. They wrote about the glorious
developments in ancient times when art and architecture, science
and mathematics, religion and culture, law and philosophy, crafts
and trade had f lourished. This glorious time, in their vie w, was
followed by a history of decline, when India was colonised. These
nationalist histories urged the readers to take pride in India’s great
achievements in the past and str uggle to c hange the miser able

These efforts to unify people were not without problems. When the

Although the Vedic, Buddhist and Jain schools had important 
differences, they also shared some common concepts, 
such as dharma, karma, rebirth, the search for an end to 
suffering and ignorance, and many important values. This 
is the ‘trunk’ of the tree we started this chapter with.
Folk and Tribal Roots
The cultural roots we have seen so far are well documented 
in many texts.  India has also had rich ‘oral traditions’, that 
is, teachings or practices transmitted through everyday 
practice, without written texts (this is the case of the 
Vedas). Among them are numerous folk traditions, that 
is, transmitted by common people, and tribal traditions, 
transmitted by tribes. 
What is a tribe? 
There are many definitions for this social entity. Today, 
anthropologists usually consider a tribe to be a group of 
families or clans sharing a tradition of common descent, a","40 OUR PASTS – III
How did Tribal Groups Live?
By the nineteenth century, tribal people in different parts 
of India were involved in a variety of activities. 
Some were jhum cultivators
Some of them practised jhum cultivation, that is, shifting 
cultivation. This was done on small patches of land, mostly 
in forests. The cultivators cut the treetops to allow sunlight 
to reach the ground, and burnt the vegetation on the land 
to clear it for cultivation. They spread the ash from the 
firing, which contained potash, to fertilise the soil. They 
used the axe to cut trees and the hoe to scratch the soil 
in order to prepare it for cultivation. They broadcast the 
seeds, that is, scattered the seeds on the field instead of 
ploughing the land  and sowing the seeds. Once the crop 
was ready and harvested, they moved to another field. 
A field that had been cultivated once was left fallow for 
several years, 
Shifting cultivators were found in the hilly and forested"
What are the main sources of India’s literary traditions?,"According to the context, the main sources of India's literary traditions are:

* Written journals and serials published by women in the early 20th century, which discussed issues like education, widowhood, and national movement.
* Folk literature printed in Punjab, such as ""Istri Dhar m Vichar"" and booklets published by the Khalsa Tract Society, teaching women about being obedient wives.
* Printed religious texts and scriptures from Bengal, including cheap editions of sacred texts and literature considered obscene or scandalous.

Note: There is no direct mention of literary traditions in the context. However, it discusses the spread of printed materials, including literature, across India.","According to the text, key sources of India's literary traditions include:

the early twentieth century, journals, written for and sometimes

issues like women’s education, widowhood, widow remarriage
and the national movement. Some of them offered household
and fashion lessons to women and brought entertainment through
short stories and serialised novels.
In Punjab, too, a similar folk literature was widely printed from
the early twentieth century. Ram Chaddha published the fast-selling
Istri Dhar m Vichar to teach women how to be obedient wi ves.
The Khalsa Tract Society published cheap booklets with a similar
message. Many of these were in the form of dialogues about the
qualities of a good woman.

An Epic Spread
Literature offers us another fine illustration of unity in 
diversity. Indian literatures are extremely diverse (and 
among the most abundant in the world). Over centuries, 
despite differences in language, technique, etc., they have 
shared important themes and concerns. Who has not 
heard of the Pañchatantra, for example? This collection 
of delightful stories, with animals as the main characters, 
teaches us important life skills. The original Sanskrit text is 
at least 2,200 years old, but its stories have been adapted in 
almost every Indian language. In fact, they have travelled 
well beyond India, all the way to Southeast Asia, the Arab 
world and Europe, inspiring new collections of stories on 
the way — it is estimated that about 200 adaptations of","India and the Contemporary World

the Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas, a sixteenth-century text, came out
from Calcutta in 1810.  By the mid-nineteenth centur y, c heap
lithographic editions flooded north Indian markets. From the 1880s,
the Naval Kishore Press at Lucknow and the Shri Venkateshwar
Press in Bombay published numerous religious texts in vernaculars.
In their printed and portable form, these could be read easily by the
faithful at any place and time. They could also be read out to large
groups of illiterate men and women.
Religious texts, therefore, reached a very wide circle of people,
encouraging discussions, debates and controversies within and
among different religions.       
Print did not only stimulate the publication of conflicting opinions
amongst communities, but it also connected communities and people
in different parts of India. Newspapers conveyed news from one
place to another, creating pan-Indian identities.

Indian culture, by any estimate, is several millenniums old. 
Like any ancient tree, it has many roots and many branches. 
The roots nurture a common trunk. And from the trunk 
emerge many branches, which are different manifestations 
of Indian culture, yet united by a common trunk.
Some of these branches are about art, literature, science, 
medicine, religion, the art of governance, martial arts, and 
so on. There are also ‘schools of thought’, by which we mean 
groups of thinkers or spiritual seekers who share similar 
ideas about human life, the world, etc.
Many archaeologists and scholars have pointed out that 
some of India’s cultural roots go all the way to the Indus 
or Harappan or Sindhu-Sarasvatī civilisation (which we

This is also the case of the god Khandoba in parts of central 
India. In eastern India, the Munda and Santhal tribals, among 
others, worship Singbonga, a supreme deity who created this 
whole world. There are many more such examples.

equally true that Hinduism, not only in its formative 
phase but throughout its evolution, has been influenced 
by tribal religions.”

the Vedas and laid emphasis on some specific values and 
practices.

methods, they also shared some important concepts; they

TO THE DIVINE
Nathpanthis, Siddhas and Yogis
A number of religious groups that 
emerged during this period criticised the 
ritual and other aspects of conventional 
religion and the social order, using 
simple, logical arguments. Among them 
were the Nathpanthis, Siddhacharas 
and Yogis. They advocated renunciation 
of the world. To them the path to 
salvation lay in meditation on the 
formless Ultimate Reality and the 
realisation of oneness with it. To achieve 
this, they advocated intense training of 
the mind and body through practices 
like 
, breathing exercises 
and meditation. These groups became 
particularly popular among “low” castes. 
Their criticism of conventional religion 
created the ground for devotional 
religion to become a popular force in

The anthropologist K.S. Singh directed 
the ‘People of India’ project we referred 
to earlier (see page 126). In the case of 
the Mahābhārata, he observed, “There 
is hardly a place in the country which 
the epic heroes such as the Pandavas, did not visit according 
to folklores.” And the same may be said of the Rāmāyaṇa. 
Over the centuries, perhaps more than any other texts, 
these two epics created a dense web of cultural interactions 
across India and many parts of Asia. Another example of 
unity in diversity.
To further illustrate the theme of this chapter , we could 
have continued our journey and turned to more facets 
of Indian culture. For instance, in India’s classical arts, 
including classical architecture, both diversity and unity 
are easily noticeable. (You will study these fields through

Nationalism   in  India
The identity of the nation, as you know (see Chapter 1), is most
often symbolised in a figure or image. This helps create an image
with which people can identify the nation. It was in the twentieth
century, with the growth of nationalism, that the identity of India
came to be visually associated with the image of Bharat Mata. The
image was first created by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhy
ay. In the
1870s he wrote ‘Vande Mataram’ as a h ymn to the mother land.
Later it was included in his novel Anandamath and widely sung during
the Swadeshi movement in Bengal. Moved by the Swadeshi
movement, Abanindranath Tagore painted his famous image of
Bharat Mata (see Fig. 12). In this painting Bharat Mata is portrayed
as an ascetic figure; she is calm, composed, divine and spiritual.
In subsequent years, the image of Bharat Mata acquired many
different forms, as it circulated in popular prints, and was painted","culture was taking shape. With the setting up of an
increasing number of printing presses, visual images
could be easily reproduced in multiple copies. Painters
like Raja Ravi Varma produced ima ges for mass
circula tion.  P oor w ood eng ravers w ho made
woodblocks set up shop near the letterpresses, and
were employed by print shops. Cheap prints and
calendars, easily available in the bazaar, could be
bought even by the poor to decorate the walls of
their homes or places of work. These prints began
shaping popular ideas about modernity and tradition,
religion and politics, and society and culture.
By the 1870s, caricatures and cartoons were being
published in journals and newspapers, commenting
on social and political issues. Some carica tures
ridiculed the educated Indians’ fascination with
Western tastes and clothes, while others expressed
the fear of social change. There were imperial
caricatures lampooning nationalists, as well as
nationalist cartoons criticising imperial rule."
What are the fundamental principles of democracy?,"Based on the provided context, the fundamental principles of democracy are:

* Enables and encourages the participation of ordinary citizens (grassroots democracy)
* Functions through elected representatives at the State and national levels
* Framework for governance that emphasizes respect to the identity and dignity of cultures and peoples.

Theme D – Governance and Democracy
Citizens of any country should know how their political 
system functions. India, as the world’s largest democracy, 
has an elaborate system working at different levels. What 
are its chief characteristics and components? How do the 
citizens participate in the overall governance? What are 
their rights and also their duties or dharma? Are there 
different systems in other countries, and, if so, of what 
type? How are different countries supposed to interact? 
By studying this theme, we can become more responsible 
citizens, understand how the organs of the government 
function, and learn to have a say in the policies that affect 
us all, whether locally or nationally.

top, the local communities have a direct say on how their 
areas are managed or the issues they face. It is a mechanism 
for citizens living in an area to come together and take 
decisions about what is best for them. 
Cities and towns are divided into smaller units called 
‘wards’, and the ward committees facilitate activities 
such as conducting health camps, organising a campaign 
against the use of single-use plastics, and so on. They also 
keep an eye on anything that might go wrong — a water 
leak, a blocked drain, a damaged road, etc. — and report 
such problems to the authorities. However , the precise

migrated to the city in search of jobs. What are the needs 
of this village — maybe water for the fields, repairing the 
main road if it got damaged by heavy rains, or maintaining 
the village’s primary school? How will the villagers take 
decisions about such matters that affect their daily lives? 
And where will they get the resources to meet those needs?

Governance and Democracy
Introduction 
Earlier chapters have shown us how, 
in a democracy, good governance  
aims to empower the citizens so they 
may actively participate in their 
country’s functioning, whether it is 
at the rural, regional, urban, state 
or national level. This is the broader 
concept of participatory democracy. 
We saw the basics of the system in 
a rural context. Let us now see how  
it works in an urban scenario. Since 
the latter is generally more complex 
and diverse than the former , it is understandable that the 
urban governance system needs to be more complex too. 
We will however limit ourselves here to its basic principles.

representatives in its formulation; it should be the same for all. All
female and male citizens are equally entitled to all honours
and public employment according to their abilities and without any

Introduction 
Earlier chapters have shown us how, 
in a democracy, good governance  
aims to empower the citizens so they 
may actively participate in their 
country’s functioning, whether it is 
at the rural, regional, urban, state 
or national level. This is the broader 
concept of participatory democracy. 
We saw the basics of the system in 
a rural context. Let us now see how  
it works in an urban scenario. Since 
the latter is generally more complex 
and diverse than the former , it is understandable that the 
urban governance system needs to be more complex too. 
We will however limit ourselves here to its basic principles.

Citizens of any country should know how their political 
system functions. India, as the world’s largest democracy, 
has an elaborate system working at different levels. What 
are its chief characteristics and components? How do the 
citizens participate in the overall governance? What are 
their rights and also their duties or dharma? Are there 
different systems in other countries, and, if so, of what 
type? How are different countries supposed to interact?

citizens, understand how the organs of the government 
function, and learn to have a say in the policies that affect 
us all, whether locally or nationally.

What is the role of the judiciary in a democracy?,"According to the context, the role of the judiciary in a democracy is to decide whether someone has broken the law and, if so, what course of action should be taken, including punishment if necessary. Additionally, it examines whether a decision taken by the executive is right or whether a law passed by the legislature is well-conceived and fair to all.","The judiciary is the system of courts which decides whether someone has broken the law and, if so, what course of action should be taken, including punishment if necessary.

  The executive is the organ that implements (or 
‘executes’) the laws. This includes the head of state

minister), the ministers and any agency responsible for 
enforcing ‘law and order’. (In our example above, that 
agency is the cyber police.)

Laws are made by the legislature, which is an assembly of representatives of the people. They review existing laws and make changes as needed.

The executive implements (or executes) the laws. This includes the head of state (such as a president or prime minister), ministers, and any agency responsible for enforcing ""law and order"".

The judiciary decides whether someone has broken the law, what course of action should be taken, including punishment if necessary. It also examines whether a decision taken by the executive is right or whether a law passed by the legislature is well conceived and fair to all.

In the case of cybercriminals, the three government organs would intervene as follows:

* The legislature reviews existing laws related to cybercrime.
* The executive (government agencies) implements the laws, including enforcement and punishment.
* The judiciary decides cases involving cybercrime, ensuring that justice is served.","According to the provided context:

A major problem was that the Brahman pandits gave 
different interpretations of local laws based on different 
schools of the dharmashastra. To bring about uniformity, 
in 1775 eleven pandits were asked to compile a digest 
of Hindu laws. N.B. Halhed translated this digest into 
English. By 1778, a code of Muslim laws was also compiled 
for the benefit of European judges. Under the Regulating 
Act of 1773, a new Supreme Court was established, while 
a court of appeal – the Sadar Nizamat Adalat – was also 
set up at Calcutta.

Introduction 
Human beings have been living in communities for a long 
time. When a large number of people live together , there 
can be disagreements and disorder , and rules become 
necessary to maintain order and harmony in the society. 
There are probably some simple rules at home that you are 
expected to follow. The school where you study has rules too 
— some for students, others for teachers. In higher classes, 
students appearing for examinations must follow certain 
rules. Drivers on the road are expected to obey traffic rules. 
People employed in all kinds of jobs also need to follow the 
rules set by their employer , while the employers must also 
follow rules which they have committed to their employees.
What would happen if no one followed those rules? A 
simple answer is that society would not be able to function.

Writing in the 1850s, G.C. Barnes gave
the following description of the Gujjars
of Kangra:
‘In the hills the Gujjars are exclusively
a pastoral tribe – they cultivate scarcely
at all. The Gaddis keep flocks of sheep
and goats and the Gujjars, wealth
consists of buffaloes. These people live
in the skirts of the forests, and maintain
their existence exclusively by the sale
of the milk, ghee, and other produce
of their herds. The men graze the
cattle, and frequently lie out for weeks
in the woods tending their herds. The
women repair to the markets every
morning with baskets on their heads,
with little earthen pots filled with milk,
butter-milk and ghee, each of these
pots containing the proportion required
for a day’s meal. During the hot
weather the Gujjars usually drive their","herds had to be shifted to the dry plateau at this time.
Banjaras were yet another well-known group of graziers. They were
to be found in the villages of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan,
Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. In search of good pastureland
for their cattle, they moved over long distances, selling plough cattle
and other goods to villagers in exchange for grain and fodder.
The accounts of many travellers tell us about the life of pastoral
groups. In the early nineteenth century , Buchanan visited the
Gollas during his travel through Mysore. He wrote:
‘Their families live in small villages near the skirt of the woods,
where they cultivate a little ground, and keep some of their
cattle, selling in the towns the produce of the dairy.
Their families are very numerous, seven to eight young men in
each being common. Two or three of these attend the flocks in
the woods, while the remainder cultivate their fields, and supply
the towns with firewood, and with straw for thatch.’","203

middlemen 
charge a 
fee for this 
service.
They would have to cycle or walk to nearby villages to sell 
the milk under scorching heat. As you know, milk spoils or 
curdles very fast in hot weather . The farmers had to sell the 
milk quickly before it could spoil. This was a lot of effort 
for the small amount of money they would earn. So, they 
depended on people called middlemen, who would buy the 
milk in bulk at meagre prices from the farmers and sell it 
in the market. Many times, the farmers felt cheated and 
harassed by the middlemen.
One day, the farmers collectively 
approached Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel,"
How do citizens influence policy-making?,"According to the context, citizens influence policy-making through mechanisms such as ward committees, which facilitate decision-making and problem-solving at a local level.

Democracy
You may have noticed that we earlier mentioned 
‘representatives of the people’. This is one of the foundation 
stones of the system of governance adopted by most countries 
of the world — democracy. The word ‘democracy’ comes 
from two Greek words — dēmos meaning ‘people’, and 
kratos meaning ‘rule’ or ‘power’; so ‘democracy’ literally 
means the ‘rule of the people’. 
But can all people actually rule? It is clearly not possible. 
Imagine there is a problem that your class wants to bring 
to the attention of your school’s principal — maybe there is 
something wrong with the classroom, or with the school’s 
infrastructure, or perhaps you would like to propose a 
certain date for a field trip. Will the entire class go to the 
principal? It would clearly not be practical. In many schools, 
classes have a ‘class monitor’ or ‘class representative’, 
whom the whole class elected; even if there is none, one","176

top, the local communities have a direct say on how their 
areas are managed or the issues they face. It is a mechanism 
for citizens living in an area to come together and take 
decisions about what is best for them. 
Cities and towns are divided into smaller units called 
‘wards’, and the ward committees facilitate activities 
such as conducting health camps, organising a campaign 
against the use of single-use plastics, and so on. They also 
keep an eye on anything that might go wrong — a water 
leak, a blocked drain, a damaged road, etc. — and report 
such problems to the authorities. However , the precise 
functioning of wards differs from State to State, depending 
on the rules they make.

Introduction 
Earlier chapters have shown us how, 
in a democracy, good governance  
aims to empower the citizens so they 
may actively participate in their 
country’s functioning, whether it is 
at the rural, regional, urban, state 
or national level. This is the broader 
concept of participatory democracy. 
We saw the basics of the system in 
a rural context. Let us now see how  
it works in an urban scenario. Since 
the latter is generally more complex 
and diverse than the former , it is understandable that the 
urban governance system needs to be more complex too. 
We will however limit ourselves here to its basic principles.

How does the media influence governance and public opinion?,"Based on the provided context, here is a concise and precise answer:

The media influences governance and public opinion by critically examining government policy, suggesting improvements, and ensuring speedy implementation. Print culture, in particular, helps spread ideas, but people do not simply accept everything they read or see. Instead, they interpret information in their own way and are influenced by various perspectives, including monarchical and Church propaganda.

Additionally, the media provides a platform for opposing views to be expressed, allowing each side to convince others of its position.","Based on the provided text:

**How does the media influence governance and public opinion?**

*   The media (newspapers, political associations) can influence governance by critically examining government policy, suggesting improvements, and ensuring speedy implementation.
*   The media (newspapers, pamphlets, books, printed pictures) can influence public opinion by describing, discussing events and changes, expressing opposing views, and spreading ideas. Print allows for the possibility of thinking differently, though people interpret information in their own way.
","Bombay Telegraph and Courier, 6 January 1849
‘The task of the native newspapers and political associations is identical to the role of the Opposition in the House of
Commons in Parliament in England. That is of critically examining government policy to suggest improvements, by removing
those parts that will not be to the benefit of the people, and also by ensuring speedy implementation.
These associations ought to carefully study the particular issues, gather diverse relevant information on the nation as well
as on what are the possible and desir able improvements, and this wi ll surely earn i t considerable influence.’

Why do some historians think that print culture created the basis for the French Revolution?

questions about the existing social order. Cartoons and caricatures
typically suggested that the monarchy remained absorbed only in
sensual pleasures while the common people suffered  immense
hardships. 
This literature circulated underground and led to the
growth of hostile sentiments against the monarchy.
How do we look at these arguments?  There can be no doubt that
print helps the spread of ideas. But we must remember that people
did not read just one kind of literature. If they read the ideas of
Voltaire and Rousseau, they were also exposed to monarchical and
Church propaganda. They were not influenced directly by everything
they read or saw. They accepted some ideas and rejected others.

How do natural resources impact economic growth?,"Based on the context, natural resources impact economic growth by enabling the transformation of semi-desert lands into fertile agricultural lands through irrigation canals, leading to increased food production and export. This, in turn, contributed to a significant increase in world trade from 1820 to 1914, with primary sector activities such as agriculture, mining, fishing, and forestry playing a major role in this growth.","As an agricultural worker who has come to America from Ireland, I chose to come here seeking a better life, hoping to find fertile land and opportunities not readily available back home. I am currently earning my living by working on a farm, cultivating grains and vegetables, which are primary sector economic activities.

**How natural resources impact economic growth:**

The context mentions that primary activities like agriculture, mining, fishing, raising livestock, and forestry are economic sectors that help with the economic prosperity of a nation. The example of the British Indian government building irrigation canals to transform semi-desert into fertile agricultural lands demonstrates how utilizing natural resources (land and water) can boost agricultural output (wheat and cotton) for export, thus impacting economic growth.
","Imagine that you are an agricultural worker who has arrived in
America from Ireland. Write a paragraph on why you chose to
come and how you are earning your living.

Some of this dramatic change, though on a smaller scale, occurred
closer home in west Punjab. Here the British Indian government
built a network of irrigation canals to transform semi-desert wastes
into fertile agricultural lands that could grow wheat and cotton for
export. The Canal Colonies, as the areas irrigated by the new canals
were called,
 were settled by peasants from other parts of Punjab.

How does international trade benefit India?,"According to the context, international trade benefits India in several ways:

* India's opium exports to China grew rapidly from the 1820s and became its single largest export, earning revenue that was used to finance imports from China.
* Indian raw materials such as cotton and indigo were exported in large quantities, with the share of raw cotton exports increasing from 5% to 35% between 1812 and 1871.

Note: The context does not provide information on how international trade benefits India beyond these specific points.","Based on the provided text, here's how international trade benefited India:

*   **Opium Trade:** India grew opium and exported it to China. The money earned from this sale was used to finance Britain's tea and other imports from China.
*   **Raw Material Exports:** Exports of raw materials from India (like raw cotton and indigo) increased.

However, the text also indicates that British exports to India were of higher value than British imports from India, resulting in a trade surplus for Britain.

**Additional information from me:**
India also benefits from international trade by getting access to newer technology, investment from other countries, employment etc.

many decades. And, as you have read last year, opium shipments to
China grew rapidly from the 1820s to become for a while India’s
single largest export. Britain grew opium in India and exported it to
China and, with the money earned through this sale, it financed its
tea and other imports from China.
Over the nineteenth century, British manufactures flooded the Indian
market. Food grain and raw material exports from India to Britain
and the rest of the world increased. But the value of British exports
to India was much higher than the value of British imports from
India. Thus Britain had a ‘trade surplus’ with India. Britain used this
surplus to balance its trade deficits with other countries – that is,
with countries from which Britain was importing more than it was
selling to. This is how a multilateral settlement system works – it","India and the Contemporary World

in other international markets. If we look at the figures of exports
from India, we see a steady decline of the share of cotton textiles:
from some 30 per cent around 1800 to 15 per cent by 1815. By the
1870s this proportion had dropped to below 3 per cent.
What, then, did India export? The figures again tell a dramatic
story.  While exports of manufactures declined rapidly, export of
raw materials increased equally fast. Between 1812 and 1871, the
share of raw cotton exports rose from 5 per cent to 35 per cent.
Indigo used for dyeing cloth was another important export for

How does inflation affect everyday life?,"According to the context, inflation affects everyday life by reducing the real value of wages. When prices rise sharply, such as during the prolonged Napoleonic War, the same wages can now buy fewer things, resulting in a decrease in the standard of living for workers.

A good place to start is the changing pattern of food production

Why is taxation necessary?,"Based on the context, taxation is necessary to finance activities of the state. In the past, richer members of the third estate (commoners) had to pay taxes to the state, including a direct tax called taille and indirect taxes on everyday consumption items like salt or tobacco. The burden of financing state activities was borne solely by the third estate.

Today, it is likely that similar taxes are collected, but the context does not provide specific information about current taxation practices.","Taxation was necessary because the burden of financing the state's activities through taxes was borne by the third estate alone. The first two estates (clergy and nobility) were exempt from paying taxes to the state.
","richer members of the third estate. The members of the first two
estates, that is, the clergy and the nobility, enjoyed certain privileges by
birth. The most important of these was exemption from paying taxes to
the state. The nobles further enjoyed feudal privileges. These included
feudal dues, which they extracted from the peasants. Peasants were obliged
to render services to the lord – to work in his house and fields – to serve
in the army or to participate in building roads.
The Church too extracted its share of taxes called tithes from the peasants,
and finally, all members of the third estate had to pay taxes to the state.
These included a direct tax, called 
taille, and a number of indirect taxes
which were levied on articles of everyday consumption like salt or tobacco.

looked for every possible source of taxation. So tax was imposed
on land, on canal water, on salt, on trade goods, and even on
animals. Pastoralists had to pay tax on every animal they grazed
on the pastures. In most pastoral tracts of India, grazing tax was
introduced in the mid-nineteenth century. The tax per head of
cattle went up rapidly and the system of collection was made
increasingly efficient. In the decades between the 1850s and 1880s
the right to collect the tax was auctioned out to contractors. These
contractors tried to extract as high a tax as they could to recover
the money they had paid to the state and earn as much profit as
they could within the year. By the 1880s the government began
collecting taxes directly from the pastoralists. Each of them was
given a pass. To enter a grazing tract, a cattle herder had to show

Activity
Source CUnder colonial rule, the life of pastoralists changed dramatically.
Their grazing grounds shrank, their movements were regulated,
and the revenue they had to pay increased. Their agricultural stock
declined and their trades and crafts were adversely affected. How?
First, the colonial state wanted to transform all grazing lands
into cultivated farms. Land revenue was one of the main sources
of its finance. By expanding cultivation it could increase its revenue
collection. It could at the same time produce more jute, cotton,
wheat and other agricultural produce that were required in
England. To colonial officials all uncultivated land appeared to
be unproductive: it produced neither revenue nor agricultural
produce. It was seen as ‘waste land’ that needed to be brought
under cultivation. From the mid-nineteenth century, Waste Land
Rules were enacted in various parts of the country. By these Rules","196

What is the impact of globalization on India’s economy?,"Based on the provided context, here is a brief answer:

The impact of globalization on India's economy during the Great Depression was severe. Indian exports grew more jute, but with hopes of greater cash, costs and debts of jute made those hopes dashed. Prices in India also plunged, with wheat prices falling by 50% between 1928 and 1934. Peasants and farmers suffered more than urban dwellers due to reduced revenue demands from the colonial government. This had a devastating impact on India's economy, particularly affecting peasants producing for the world market.","The Great Depression, a global economic crisis, significantly impacted India's economy. As India was integrated into the global economy, the crisis in other parts of the world was quickly relayed to India. India's exports and imports nearly halved between 1928 and 1934, and prices in India plunged. Peasants and farmers, especially those producing for the world market, suffered greatly as agricultural prices fell sharply, while the colonial government refused to reduce revenue demands.
","between 1929 and 1932 about 110, 000 companies had collapsed.
By 1935, a modest economic recovery was under way in most
industrial countries. But the Great Depression’s wider effects on
society, politics and international relations, and on peoples’ minds,
proved more enduring.
3.5 India and the Great Depression
If we look at the impact of the depression on India we realise
how integrated the global economy had become by the early
twentieth century. The tremors of a crisis in one part of the world
were quickly relayed to other parts, affecting lives, economies and
societies worldwide.
In the nineteenth century, as you have seen, colonial India had become
an exporter of agricultural goods and importer of manufactures.
The depression immediately affected Indian trade. India’s exports

and imports nearly halved between 1928 and 1934. As international
prices crashed, prices in India also plunged. Between 1928 and 1934,
wheat prices in India fell by 50 per cent.
Peasants and farmers suffered more than urban dwellers. Though
agricultural prices fell sharply, the colonial government refused to
reduce revenue demands. Peasants producing for the world market
were the worst hit.
Consider the jute producers of Bengal. They grew raw jute that was
processed in factories for export in the form of gunny bags. But
as gunny exports collapsed, the price of raw jute crashed more than
60 per cent. Peasants who borrowed in the hope of better times or
to increase output in the hope of higher incomes faced ever lower","India and the Contemporary World

How does technology contribute to economic development?,"According to the context, technology contributed to economic development by enabling specialization in commodity production, leading to an increase in world trade. The inventions of railways, steamships, and telegraphs were important technological advances that facilitated faster and cheaper transportation of goods, which stimulated new investments and improvements in transport. This, in turn, helped move food more cheaply and quickly from faraway farms to final markets, contributing to economic development.","Technology contributes to economic development by enabling specialization in the production of commodities, as seen in the 19th-century world where trade multiplied significantly. Railways, steamships, and the telegraph facilitated the movement of goods, especially primary products, more cheaply and quickly. Colonization stimulated new investments and improvements in transport technologies, further enhancing trade. Also, number of economic activities has increased due to technology as societies progressed.
","specialisation in the production of  commodities de velop, tha t
between 1820 and 1914 world trade is estimated to have multiplied
25 to 40 times. Nearly 60 per cent of this trade comprised ‘primary
products’ – that is, agricultural products such as wheat and cotton,
and minerals such as coal.
2.2 Role of Technology
What was the role of technology in all this? The railways, steamships,
the telegraph, for example, were important inventions without
which we cannot imagine the transformed nineteenth-century world.
But technological advances were often the result of larger social,
political and economic factors. For example, colonisation stimulated
new investments and improvements in transport: faster railways,
lighter wagons and larger ships helped move food more cheaply
and quickly from faraway farms to f
inal markets.

What are the different types of employment in India?,"Based on the context, the different types of employment in India mentioned are:

1. Factory workers: These were employed in textile mills and other industries.
2. Artisans: They worked in their traditional occupations such as weaving cloth, pottery, etc.
3. Peasants: They worked in agriculture and related activities.
4. Jobbers: They acted as intermediaries between the factories and the workers, getting new recruits and ensuring they got jobs.

*   **Factory workers:** Peasants and artisans migrating from villages to work in factories (e.g., cotton mills). The number of factory workers increased from 584,000 in 1901 to over 2,436,000 by 1946.

*   **Jobbers:** Individuals who recruited workers for factories, often from their own villages. They helped workers settle in the city and sometimes provided financial assistance.

own chambers of commerce which Indian businessmen were not
allowed to join.
4.2 Where Did the Workers Come From?
Factories needed workers. With the expansion of  factories, this
demand increased. In 1901, there were 584,000 workers in Indian
factories. By 1946 the number was over 2,436, 000. 
Where did the
workers come from?
 In most industrial regions workers came from the districts around.

industrial centres in search of work. Over 50 per cent workers in the
Bombay cotton industries in 1911 came from the neighbouring
district of Ratnagiri, while the mills of Kanpur got most of their","India and the Contemporary World

Getting jobs was always difficult, even when mills multiplied and
the demand for workers increased. The numbers seeking work were
always more than the jobs available.  Entry into the mills was also
restricted. Industrialists usually employed a jobber to get new recruits.
Very often the jobber was an old and trusted worker. He got people
from his village, ensured them jobs, helped them settle in the city
and provided them money in times of crisis. The jobber therefore
became a per son with some authority and po wer. He be gan

The number of factory workers increased over time. However,
as you will see, they were a small proportion of the total
industrial workforce.

A Map and Its Components
From this simple example, we understand that a map is a 
representation, or a drawing, of some area — it may be a 
small area (a village, a town, etc.), a bigger area (say, your 
district or state), or a very large area like India or even the 
whole world. In a map, you look at the surface as if you are 
viewing it from the top.
An atlas is a book or collection of maps.
As you will discover , there are several kinds of maps —","different kinds of buildings (for instance a railway station, 
a school, a post office), for roads and railway lines, and for 
natural elements such as a river , a pond or a forest. In that 
way, numerous details can be shown in the limited space 
available on a map.
To make maps more easily understood by a variety of users, 
map makers use specific symbols. Different countries use 
different sets of symbols. The Survey of India, a government 
body, has fixed a set of symbols for maps of India (or parts 
of India). A small selection of them is shown in Fig. 1.2 on

How do latitude and longitude help in locating places?,"Latitude and longitude help in locating places by providing a system of coordinates. Latitude measures distance from the Equator, increasing as you travel towards one of the poles. Longitude measures distance from the Prime Meridian, increasing as you travel eastward or westward along the Equator. Together, latitude and longitude allow for precise location of any place on Earth, using statements like ""Delhi lies at 29°N latitude and 77°E longitude"".","Latitude measures the distance from the Equator, while longitude measures the distance from the Prime Meridian. Together, latitude and longitude are the two coordinates of a place, enabling you to locate any place on Earth.
","13
1 – Locating Places on the Earth
Here we will study the globe representing 
the Earth’s geography. Because the globe 
and the Earth have the same spherical 
shape, a globe will better represent the 
geography of the Earth than a flat map. 
Let us now explore some of its features.
a) Understanding coordinates
Imagine a big market in a city or town, with 
neat rows of shops, all the same size. You 
want to meet a friend at a stationery shop 
inside the market. But your friend does 
not know where the shop is. So you would give directions 
like, “Meet me at 6 pm at the 7th shop in the 5 th row from 
the entrance.” This will allow your friend to precisely  
determine your location. 
Now, consider a chessboard. 
To record moves by advanced 
players, letters are placed 
alongside the main pieces 
(from ‘a’ to ‘h’, see the image) 
and numbers (from 1 to 8) in 
between the two sides. This 
simple system allows players 
to mark each square and 
record every move. Here, the","14 Exploring Society: India and Beyond  
India and the World: Land and the People
The system used in these two examples may be called a 
system of coordinates. Thanks to their two coordinates, 
the stationery shop as well as the chess square on the 
chessboard can be precisely determined.
A similar system of coordinates is used in the world of maps 
to determine the location of any place on a map. Let us see 
how this system works.
b) Latitudes
Let us return to the globe. It is easy to identify the North 
Pole and the South Pole on it. Rotate the globe; while it 
rotates, the fixed points at the top and bottom are the two 
poles. Halfway between them is the Equator; note the circle 
marking it (see Fig. 1.3). 
Imagine that you stand on the Equator and travel towards 
one of the poles; your distance from the Equator increases. 
Latitude measures this distance from the Equator . At any 
point of this travel, you can draw an imaginary line that","marked as 0° longitude. 
Just as latitude is a measure of the distance from the 
Equator if you travel towards one of the poles, longitude is 
a measure of the distance from the Prime Meridian if you 
travel along the Equator . Longitude, too, is measured in 
degrees. Westward or eastward, it increases in value from 
0° to 180°, with the letter ‘W’ or ‘E’ added. For instance, 
using round figures, New York’s longitude is 74°W, while 
Delhi’s is 77°E and Tokyo’s is 140°E.
DON’T MISS OUT
As you can see on the globe of meridians of longitudes, 180°W 
and 180°E are the same longitude; so this longitude is noted 
180°, omitting the letter W or E. 
Latitude and longitude together are the two coordinates of 
a place. With them, you are now able to locate any place on 
Earth! You can now understand a statement such as “Delhi 
lies at 29°N latitude and 77°E longitude” (these values are 
rounded off, not exact).
Fig. 1.3 on page 15 shows the parallels of latitude and the"
What is the significance of the Prime Meridian?,"According to the context, the significance of the Prime Meridian is that it serves as a reference point for measuring longitude and dividing the Earth into Western and Eastern Hemispheres. It is also marked as 0° longitude.","The Prime Meridian is a reference point used to measure longitudes. It is marked as 0° longitude and passes through Greenwich, England. In 1884, some nations decided it would become the international standard for the Prime Meridian.

The Greenwich Meridian is not the first prime meridian. 
There were others in the past. In fact, many centuries before 
Europe, India had a prime meridian of its own! (Fig. 1.5) It 
was called madhya rekhā (or ‘middle line’) and passed through 
the city of Ujjayinī (today Ujjain), which was a reputed centre 
for astronomy over many centuries. Varāhamihira, a famous 
astronomer , lived and worked there some 1,500 years ago.","16 Exploring Society: India and Beyond

eastward, we can note that for some places on the Earth it 
is morning, while for others it is mid-day, evening or night 
— when it’s breakfast time in one country, it’s lunchtime in 
another and in a third country people are fast asleep! That 
is why by measuring the longitude of a place, we will also 
be measuring the time at that place. Let us see how. 
To measure longitudes, we need to define a reference point 
called the Prime Meridian (Fig. 1.3 on page 15). It is also 
called Greenwich Meridian because, in the year 1884, 
some nations decided that the meridian passing through 
Greenwich, an area of London in England, would become 
the international standard for the Prime Meridian. It is 
marked as 0° longitude.

Equator if you travel towards one of the poles, longitude is","felt, tasted, smelled, or somehow

Why is the Equator called 0° latitude?,"According to the context, the Equator is called 0° latitude because it is a convention to express latitudes in degrees, and by definition, the Equator is considered the starting point or reference point for measuring distance from one of the poles.","The Equator is called 0° latitude because latitude measures distance from the Equator.
","one of the poles; your distance from the Equator increases. 
Latitude measures this distance from the Equator . At any 
point of this travel, you can draw an imaginary line that 
runs east and west, parallel to the Equator . Such a line is 
called a parallel of latitude and it draws a circle around 
the Earth. Again, it is easy to note on the globe that the 
largest circle is the Equator , while the circles marked by the 
parallels of latitude grow smaller as we move northward or 
southward (Fig. 1.3). 
Latitudes are expressed in degrees; by convention, the 
Equator is latitude 0° (zero degree), while the latitudes of 
the two poles are 90° North and 90° South respectively; this 
is noted 90°N and 90°S.
There is a connection between latitude and climate. Around 
the Equator , the climate is generally hot (it is also called 
‘torrid’). As you travel away from the Equator towards one 
of the two poles (in other words, as your latitude increases),","the Equator , the climate is generally hot (it is also called 
‘torrid’). As you travel away from the Equator towards one

closer to the North or South Pole, the climate grows colder 
(or ‘frigid’). You will learn in Science why this is so, and

Just as latitude is a measure of the distance from the 
Equator if you travel towards one of the poles, longitude is 
a measure of the distance from the Prime Meridian if you 
travel along the Equator . Longitude, too, is measured in 
degrees. Westward or eastward, it increases in value from 
0° to 180°, with the letter ‘W’ or ‘E’ added. For instance, 
using round figures, New York’s longitude is 74°W, while 
Delhi’s is 77°E and Tokyo’s is 140°E.
DON’T MISS OUT
As you can see on the globe of meridians of longitudes, 180°W 
and 180°E are the same longitude; so this longitude is noted 
180°, omitting the letter W or E. 
Latitude and longitude together are the two coordinates of 
a place. With them, you are now able to locate any place on 
Earth! You can now understand a statement such as “Delhi 
lies at 29°N latitude and 77°E longitude” (these values are 
rounded off, not exact).

Mapping the Earth
Mapping the Earth is a little more difficult because our  
planet is not a flat surface. It nearly has the shape of a 
sphere. (We say ‘nearly’ because it is not a perfect sphere, 
but is slightly flattened at the poles. However , in practice, 
we will consider it to be spherical.) Representing a sphere 
accurately on a flat sheet of paper is not possible. To 
understand why, peel an orange in such a way that you 
have just three or four large pieces of the skin; then try and 
flatten them on a table — you will see that you cannot do it 
without tearing them at the edges.
Now, consider a globe, which is a sphere on which a map 
is drawn. This may be a map of the Earth, the Moon, the

A Map and Its Components
From this simple example, we understand that a map is a 
representation, or a drawing, of some area — it may be a 
small area (a village, a town, etc.), a bigger area (say, your 
district or state), or a very large area like India or even the 
whole world. In a map, you look at the surface as if you are 
viewing it from the top.
An atlas is a book or collection of maps.
As you will discover , there are several kinds of maps —","different kinds of buildings (for instance a railway station, 
a school, a post office), for roads and railway lines, and for 
natural elements such as a river , a pond or a forest. In that 
way, numerous details can be shown in the limited space 
available on a map.
To make maps more easily understood by a variety of users, 
map makers use specific symbols. Different countries use 
different sets of symbols. The Survey of India, a government 
body, has fixed a set of symbols for maps of India (or parts 
of India). A small selection of them is shown in Fig. 1.2 on 
page 12.

How is the scale of a map determined?,"According to the context, the scale of a map is determined by comparing the distance on the map with the actual distance on the ground. For example, in Fig. 1.1, each centimeter on the map represents a certain distance on the ground (500 meters). Similarly, in Fig. 5.2, the scale is represented as ""1 cm = 500 km"", which means that 2.5 cm on the printed map corresponds to 500 kilometers on the ground.","The scale of a map is determined by the relationship between a distance on the map and the corresponding distance on the ground. For example, ""1 cm = 500 m"" means each centimetre on the map represents 500 metres on the ground.

1.1. Let us now define them more precisely.
Have you ever wondered how a huge place can fit on a small 
piece of paper? It is all thanks to the map’s scale. Let us go 
back to our map of a small city (Fig. 1.1). Each centimetre 
on the map, as printed here, represents a certain distance 
on the ground — let us suppose it is 500 metres; we say that 
the scale is 1 cm = 500 m. Now, turn to the map of India in  
Fig. 5.2 in Chapter 5 of this textbook. The scale is repre-
sented in the bottom left corner by a ruler with ‘500’ written 
above its length and ‘km’ on the side. It simply means that 
this ruler , which measures 2.5 cm in the printed map, 
corresponds to 500 kilometres on the ground.   
So, the actual distance between two points represented on 
the map depends on the scale that the map is using.

Although we have listed five oceans, it is clear from the 
map that they are not really separate. The lines that divide 
them on the map are no more than conventions — the 
natural world does not follow such boundaries. Seawater , 
for example, constantly flows across different oceans, 
sustaining a rich diversity of marine life. Many plant and 
animal species can be found across multiple oceans. 
The marine flora includes tiny plants called algae and all 
kinds of seaweeds; the marine fauna consists of thousands 
of species of colourful fish, dolphins, whales, and countless 
mysterious deep-sea creatures. Each part of the ocean, from 
the sun-lit surface to the dark depths, has its own diverse 
life forms.

Oceans have deeply impacted humanity in many other

to conduct military campaigns, and as a source of food

1.2 On the Plateaus, Plains and Deserts
Not all pastoralists operated in the mountains. They were also to be
found in the plateaus, plains and deserts of India.
Dhangars were an important pastoral community of Maharashtra.
In the early twentieth century their population in this region was
estimated to be 467,000. Most of them were shepherds, some were
blanket weavers, and still others were buffalo herders. The Dhangar
shepherds stayed in the central plateau of Maharashtra during the
monsoon. This was a semi-arid region with low rainfall and poor
soil. It was covered with thorny scrub. Nothing but dry crops like
bajra could be sown here. In the monsoon this tract became a vast
grazing ground for the Dhangar flocks. By October the Dhangars
harvested their bajra and started on their move west. After a march
of about a month they reached the Konkan. This was a flourishing
agricultural tract with high rainfall and rich soil. Here the shepherds","period onwards, we have records of adivasi communities trading
elephants and other goods like hides, horns, silk cocoons, ivory,
bamboo, spices, fibres, grasses, gums and resins through nomadic
communities like the Banjaras.
With the coming of the British, however, trade was completely
regulated by the government. The British government gave many
large European trading firms the sole right to trade in the forest
products of particular areas. Grazing and hunting by local people
were restricted. In the process, many pastoralist and nomadic
communities like the Korava, Karacha and Yerukula of the Madras
Presidency lost their livelihoods. Some of them began to be called
‘criminal tribes’, and were forced to work instead in factories,
mines and plantations, under government supervision.
New opportunities of work did not always mean improved well-
being for the people. In Assam, both men and women from forest

To administer the affairs of the Maasai, the British introduced
a series of measures that had important implications. They
appointed chiefs of different sub-groups of Maasai, who were
made responsible for the affairs of the tribe. The British
imposed various restrictions on raiding and warfare.
Consequently, the traditional authority of both elders and
warriors was adversely affected.
The chiefs appointed by the colonial government often
accumulated wealth over time. They had a regular income with
which they could buy animals, goods and land. They lent
money to poor neighbours who needed cash to pay taxes. Many
of them began living in towns, and became involved in trade.
Their wives and children stayed back in the villages to look
after the animals. These chiefs managed to survive the
devastations of war and drought. They had both pastoral and
non-pastoral income, and could buy animals when their stock
was depleted."

wood for fuel, grass, charcoal, packaging, fruits, flowers, animals,
birds and many other things. In the Amazon forests or in the
Western Ghats, it is possible to find as many as 500 different plant
species in one forest patch.

How do mountains influence climate and precipitation?,"According to the context, mountains influence climate and precipitation by:

* At high altitudes, snow may never melt, leaving the mountain permanently snow-capped.
* In cold conditions, snow falls at higher altitudes, covering the landscape in a white blanket.

These factors contribute to the formation of snow and hailstones, which are forms of precipitation.","Mountains influence climate and precipitation by being covered with snow at high altitudes. At lower altitudes, the snow melts and turns into water that feeds rivers. At higher altitudes, the snow may never melt, leaving the mountain permanently snow-capped. At higher altitudes, if it is cold enough, snow will fall, covering the landscape.

may never melt, leaving the mountain permanently snow-

Other highlands with a lower height, less steep slopes and 
rounded tops are called hills.
THINK ABOUT IT
What is snow? Unless you live in a Himalayan region (such  
as Kashmir , Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, 
Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh), you may never have seen  
snow! In the rest of India, most precipitation is in the form 
of rain and hail. But at higher altitudes, if it is cold enough,  
snow will fall, covering the landscape in a soft and beautiful 
white blanket. Snow and hailstones are nothing but 
precipitation of water in a solid state.

Mountains with tall and sharp peaks, like the Himalayas, 
are relatively ‘young’, which means that they were formed 
recently in the Earth’s history — but that is still millions 
of years ago! Shorter and more rounded mountains and 
hills, like the Aravalli Range, are much older and have been 
rounded by erosion. Sometimes, as with the Himalayas, 
upliftment as well as erosion continue to this day. (You 
will learn more in Science about such processes and their 
causes; let us just say here that some mountains of the 
world, like the Himalayas, are still growing in height.)
Mountain environment
Mountain slopes are often covered with a type of forest 
called montane forest,  where conifer trees such as pines, 
firs, spruce and deodar are common. These conifer trees 
grow tall and cone-shaped, with thin, pointed leaves. At 
higher altitudes, the trees give way to grasses, mosses and

Why are mountain regions less populated compared to plains?,"According to the context, mountain regions are less populated compared to plains because they have steep slopes and a narrow summit, making it difficult for people to settle and live there. Additionally, many mountainous regions rely on herding as their primary occupation rather than agriculture, which may also contribute to fewer people living in these areas.","Mountain regions have fewer inhabitants than plains due to steep slopes and narrow summits, making settlement difficult.

Plains
Plains are landforms that have an extensive flat or gently 
undulating surface. They do not have any large hills or deep 
valleys. They are generally not more than 300 metres above 
sea level. 
Floodplains are one type of plains formed by rivers 
originating in mountain ranges, where they collect  
particles of rock, sand and silt called ‘sediments’. These 
sediments are carried all the way to the plains, where 
the rivers deposit them, making the soil very fertile. As a 
result, these plains are ideal for growing crops of all kinds, 
and agriculture is a major economic occupation in this","with other groups.

A landform is a physical feature on the surface of our  
planet Earth. Landforms take shape over millions of years 
and have a significant connection with the environment 
and life. They can broadly be divided into three categories 
— mountains, plateaus and plains (Fig. 3.1). 
These landforms have different climates and are home to 
a variety of flora and fauna. Humans have adapted to all 
landforms, but the number of people living on different 
kinds of landforms varies throughout the world. 
Mountains 
Mountains are landforms that are much higher than the 
surrounding landscape. They can be recognised by a broad 
base, steep slopes and a narrow summit. Depending on 
their height, some mountains are covered with snow. At 
lower altitudes, the snow melts every summer and turns

Mountains with tall and sharp peaks, like the Himalayas, 
are relatively ‘young’, which means that they were formed 
recently in the Earth’s history — but that is still millions 
of years ago! Shorter and more rounded mountains and 
hills, like the Aravalli Range, are much older and have been 
rounded by erosion. Sometimes, as with the Himalayas, 
upliftment as well as erosion continue to this day. (You 
will learn more in Science about such processes and their 
causes; let us just say here that some mountains of the 
world, like the Himalayas, are still growing in height.)
Mountain environment
Mountain slopes are often covered with a type of forest 
called montane forest,  where conifer trees such as pines, 
firs, spruce and deodar are common. These conifer trees 
grow tall and cone-shaped, with thin, pointed leaves. At 
higher altitudes, the trees give way to grasses, mosses and 
lichen."
What is the significance of sheep shearing?,"The significance of sheep shearing is that it marks a seasonal change and adjustment for pastoral communities in the Himalayas, such as the Bhotiyas, Sherpas, and Kinnauris. The process involves bathing and cleaning the sheep before their wool is cut, likely indicating a time of preparation for the coming winter or a shift to new pastures.","The significance of sheep shearing for communities like the Gaddis is that it provides wool, which is used in cloth production. The Gaddi shepherds halt on their way down from the high meadows to have their sheep sheared after bathing and cleaning them.
","and winter pastures was typical of many pastoral
communities of the Himalayas, including the
Bhotiyas, Sherpas and Kinnauris. All of them had
to adjust to seasonal changes and make effective use
of available pastures in different places. When the
pasture was exhausted or unusable in one place they
moved their herds and flock to new areas. This
continuous movement also allowed the pastures to
recover; it prevented their overuse.
Fig.4 – Gaddi sheep being sheared.
By September the Gaddi shepherds come down from the high
meadows (Dhars). On the way down they halt  for a while to have
their sheep sheared. The sheep are bathed and cleaned before the
wool is cut.

2024-25","This increase was linked to
a number of changes within the process of production. Let us look
briefly at some of these.
A series of inventions in the eighteenth century increased the efficacy
of each step of the production process ( carding, twisting and
spinning, and rolling). They enhanced the output per worker, enabling
each worker to produce more, and they made possible the
production of stronger threads and yarn. Then Richard Arkwright
created the cotton mill. Till this time, as you have seen, cloth
production was spread all over the countryside and carried out within
village households. But now, the costly new machines could be
purchased, set up and maintained in the mill. Within the mill all the

could remain in the countryside and continue to cultivate their small
plots. Income from proto-industrial production supplemented their
shrinking income from cultivation. It also allowed them a fuller use
of their family labour resources.
Within this system a close relationship developed between the town
and the countryside. Merchants were based in towns but the work
was done mostly in the countryside. A merchant clothier in England
purchased wool from a wool stapler, and carried it to the spinners;
the yarn (thread) that was spun was taken in subsequent stages
of production to weavers, fullers, and then to dyers. The finishing
was done in London before the export merchant sold the cloth in
the international market. London in fact came to be known as a
finishing centre.
This proto-industrial system was thus part of a network of
commercial exchanges. It was controlled by merchants and the goods"

African Plateau is famous for gold and diamond mining. In 
India, huge reserves of iron, coal and manganese are found 
in the Chhota Nagpur Plateau. 
The plateau environment is very diverse across the world. 
Many plateaus have a rocky soil, which makes them less 
fertile than plains (see next section) and therefore less 
favourable to farming. An exception is that of lava plateaus 
(that is, formed through volcanic activity), as they often 
have a rich black soil.
Plateaus are also home to many spectacular waterfalls.

Plains are landforms that have an extensive flat or gently 
undulating surface. They do not have any large hills or deep 
valleys. They are generally not more than 300 metres above 
sea level. 
Floodplains are one type of plains formed by rivers 
originating in mountain ranges, where they collect  
particles of rock, sand and silt called ‘sediments’. These 
sediments are carried all the way to the plains, where 
the rivers deposit them, making the soil very fertile. As a 
result, these plains are ideal for growing crops of all kinds, 
and agriculture is a major economic occupation in this"
How have ancient Indian traditions classified landforms through Tiṇai?,"According to ancient Indian traditions, landforms have been classified into five tiṇais: Kuriñji (mountainous regions), Mullai (grassland and forests), Marudam (fertile agricultural plains), Neydal (coastal regions), and Pālai (arid, desert-like regions).","Ancient Indian traditions, specifically through the Tiṇai system of Sangam poetry, classified landforms into five types: mountainous regions (Kuriñji), grassland and forests (Mullai), fertile agricultural plains (Marudam), coastal regions (Neydal), and arid, desert-like regions (Pālai).

3 – Landforms and Life
The five tiṇais of ancient Tamil Sangam poetry are five 
landscapes associated with certain specific deities, lifestyles, 
moods or emotions (such as love, longing, separation, quarrel, 
etc.). This table only lists the characteristics of the five 
landscapes and the main human occupations in each:
Tiṇai Landscape Main occupation
Kuriñji mountainous regions hunting and gathering
Mullai grassland and forests cattle rearing
Marudam fertile agricultural plains farming
Neydal coastal regions fishing and seafaring
Pālai arid, desert-like regions journeying and fighting
These five tiṇais constitute a different classification of 
landforms than the one we have seen, but they reflect a keen 
awareness of the diverse regions and their characteristics. 
They also illustrate the deep connection between humanity 
and the natural environment. (You do not need to remember 
the details of the tiṇais, but the concepts they reflect need to be 
understood.)","They also illustrate the deep connection between humanity

What is the role of a timeline in history?,"According to the context, a timeline plays several roles in history:

1. It helps mark events and shows their sequence over a particular period.
2. It enables understanding of the order in which historical events take place.
3. It provides a convenient tool for marking dates and events.

The context also mentions that historians use timelines to associate history with specific dates, as it was once an account of battles and big events, focusing on rulers' policies and events like coronations, marriages, births, wars, and deaths.","According to the provided text, a timeline in history serves two main roles:

1.  **Marking Events:** It is a tool to mark events by showing a sequence of dates and events covering a particular period.
2.  **Understanding Order:** It helps in understanding the order in which historical events take place.
","64 Exploring Society: India and Beyond  
Tapestry of the Past
A timeline (see Fig. 4.3 on pages 62 and 63) is a convenient 
tool to mark such events, as it shows a sequence of dates 
and events covering any particular period. It runs from the 
beginning of humanity to the present, with a few important 
landmarks. Note that the dotted portion marks a skipped 
period; otherwise, this timeline would have to be almost 3 
metres long!

A timeline also helps in understanding the order in which 
historical events take place. For example, even without 
looking at dates, you can now see that the birth of Buddha 
occurs before that of Jesus. 
DON’T MISS OUT
Along with a year and a decade (a period of ten years), we often 
use other terms to understand longer durations of time. Two of 
these are quite commonly used when learning about history.
1. Century: It is any period of 100 years. In history, specific","Why, then, do we continue to associate history with 
a string of dates? This association has a reason. There 
was a time when history was an account of battles and big 
events. It was about rulers and their policies. Historians 
wrote about the year a king was crowned, the year he 
married, the year he had a child, the year he fought a 
particular war, the year he died, and the year the next 
ruler succeeded to the throne. For events such as these, 
specific dates can be determined, and in histories such 
as these, debates about dates continue to be important. 
As you have seen in the history textbooks of the past 
two years, historians now write about a host of other 
issues, and other questions. They look at how people 
earned their livelihood, what they produced and ate, how 
cities developed and markets came up, how kingdoms 
were formed and new ideas spread, and how cultures 
and society changed.
Which dates?
By what criteria do we choose a set of dates as","2 OUR PASTS – III
All such historical questions refer us back to 
notions of time. But time does not have to be always 
precisely dated in terms of a particular year or a month. 
Sometimes it is actually incorrect to fix precise dates 
to processes that happen over a period of time. People 
in India did not begin drinking tea one fine day; they 
developed a taste for it over time. There can be no 
one clear date for a process such as this. Similarly, 
we cannot fix one single date on which British rule 
was established, or the national movement started, or 
changes took place within the economy and society. All 
these things happened over a stretch of time. We can 
only refer to a span of time, an approximate period over 
which particular changes became visible.

a string of dates? This association has a reason. There

for calculating the dates of festivals and other auspicious 
events.
In the West, the conventional year for Jesus Christ’s birth 
has generally been taken to be the starting point for this

India? Many Indian calendars rely on the positions of the sun 
and the moon to define the months of the year . A pañchānga is 
a book of tables which lists the days of each month along with 
related astronomical data; for instance, it precisely predicts 
events like solar and lunar eclipses, times for sunrise and 
sunset, etc. Pañchāngas, still widely used in India, often also 
give weather predictions for the year , dates and timings of 
festivals, and more.

* BCE: Years before Jesus' birth (e.g., 560 BCE)","CE (Common Era) and BCE (Before Common Era) are used to mark years in a calendar. CE denotes years counted forward from the conventional year of Jesus Christ's birth, while BCE denotes years counted backward from that point.

"Why is there no ""Year Zero"" in the Gregorian calendar?","According to the context, there is no ""Year Zero"" in the Gregorian calendar because the year 1 CE follows immediately after the year 1 BCE.

 Æ Such calculations are simple, but there is a catch. In the

follows immediately the year 1 BCE. Draw a simple timeline 
marking every year from 2 BCE to 2 CE; you will see that 
because of the absence of a year zero, only 3 years have 
passed between those two dates. 
 Æ So to calculate the number of years between a BCE date 
and a CE date, you should add them but subtract 1 — in the 
above case, 2 + 2 – 1 = 3. 
 Æ Practice a few examples with your classmates. For example, 
to return to the question about the Buddha, suppose we 
are now in the year 2024 CE, then the Buddha was born

The Beginnings of Human History
Modern humans (Homo sapiens) have walked the planet 
for about 300,000 (three lakh) years. This appears to be a 
very long time, yet it is only a tiny fraction of the Earth’s 
history. Let us have a quick look at our early history.
LET’S EXPLORE
In the above picture, look at some activities of early humans 
in a rock shelter . Which ones can you recognise? Give a brief 
description for each.
Early humans faced many challenges from nature and lived 
in bands or groups to help each other . They were constantly 
seeking shelter and food, and were mainly hunters and 
gatherers; this means that they relied on hunting and 
collecting edible plants and fruits for their survival. Our 
early ancestors also had certain beliefs about the natural 
elements and possibly also some notion of afterlife.

to Rajputs by their poets and bards. Other groups

politically important. 
Throughout this period there was a gradual

Members of each tribe were united by kinship 
bonds. Many tribes obtained their livelihood from 
agriculture. Others were hunter-gatherers or herders. 
Most often they combined these activities to make 
full use of the natural resources of the area in which 
they lived. Some tribes were nomadic and moved 
from one place to another. A tribal group controlled 
land and pastures jointly, and divided these amongst 
households according to its own rules.

The vast plains of the Punjab (today 
divided between India and Pakistan) and 
Sindh (now in Pakistan) are watered by 
the Indus River and its tributaries. This 
made those plains fertile and, therefore, 
favourable to agriculture. A little further 
east, a few millenniums ago, another 
river , the Sarasvatī, used to flow from 
the foothills of the Himalayas through 
Haryana, Punjab, parts of Rajasthan 
and Gujarat (see Fig. 6.3). In this whole 
region, from about 3500 BCE, villages 
grew into towns, and with increasing 
trade and other exchanges, those towns 
further grew into cities. This transition 
happened around 2600 BCE. 
Archaeologists gave this civilisation 
several names — ‘Indus’, ‘Harappan’, 
‘Indus-Sarasvatī’ or ‘Sindhu-Sarasvatī’

These groups lived in temporary camps, rock shelters or 
caves, and communicated with each other using languages 
that are now lost. They used fire and started making objects 
that made their lives easier , like improved stone axes and 
blades, arrowheads and other tools. Aspects of their life 
are visible in rock paintings found in hundreds of caves 
all over the world. Some of those paintings depict simple 
figures or a few symbols; others are more detailed and 
represent scenes with animals or humans. In time, these 
early humans learned to make simple ornaments such as 
stone or shell beads, pendants made of animal teeth, and 
sometimes exchanged them with other groups.

The Beginnings of Human History
Modern humans (Homo sapiens) have walked the planet

very long time, yet it is only a tiny fraction of the Earth’s 
history. Let us have a quick look at our early history.

In the above picture, look at some activities of early humans 
in a rock shelter . Which ones can you recognise? Give a brief 
description for each.
Early humans faced many challenges from nature and lived 
in bands or groups to help each other . They were constantly 
seeking shelter and food, and were mainly hunters and 
gatherers; this means that they relied on hunting and 
collecting edible plants and fruits for their survival. Our 
early ancestors also had certain beliefs about the natural 
elements and possibly also some notion of afterlife.

within defined territorial boundaries.

of our study. There are times when a focus on a small region - a locality, a village, an island,
a desert tract, a forest, a mountain - helps us understand the rich variety in people’s lives and
histories that make up the life of the nation. We cannot talk of the nation without the

India's territorial extent has changed significantly over time. The region, often called the ""Indian Subcontinent,"" has had shifting boundaries and different names throughout history. The context mentions that India 500, 2000, or even 5000 years ago was very different from the modern nation with defined borders and states that we know today. The context also shows how the British territorial power expanded in India over time (1797, 1840 and 1857).

we see this connection. This is particularly true about a world in which economies and
societies have become increasingly inter-connected. History cannot be always contained
within defined territorial boundaries.
In any case there is no reason to think of national territorial boundaries as the only valid unit
of our study. There are times when a focus on a small region - a locality, a village, an island,
a desert tract, a forest, a mountain - helps us understand the rich variety in people’s lives and
histories that make up the life of the nation. We cannot talk of the nation without the
people, nor the locality without the nation. Borrowing from the statement of a famous
French historian, Fernand Braudel, we may also say: it is not possible to talk of the nation
without the world.

5 ― India, That Is Bharat
Today, the India we know is a modern nation, with defined 
borders, defined states and a known population. However , 
it was very different 500 years ago, 2,000 years ago or even 
5,000 years ago. This region of the world, which we often call 
the ‘Indian Subcontinent’, has had many different names 
and shifting boundaries. We can learn about India’s past 
and evolution from many different sources. Let us explore.
THINK ABOUT IT 
Consider the physical map of the Indian Subcontinent at 
the start of the chapter. What are its natural boundaries 
that you can make out?
In the course of history, India has been called by many  
names — both by its inhabitants and by visitors from outside. 
These names come to us from ancient texts, accounts of 
travellers and pilgrims, and inscriptions.

unique personality. By understanding them and their roots, 
we can understand ‘India, that is Bharat’ better .
The Vedas and Vedic Culture
a. What are the Vedas? 
The word “Veda” comes from the Sanskrit vid which 
means ‘knowledge’ (hence vidyā, for instance). We briefly 
mentioned the Ṛig Veda in earlier chapters. In fact, there 
are four Vedas — the Ṛig Veda, the Yajur Veda, the Sāma 
Veda and the Atharva Veda. They are the most ancient texts 
of India, and indeed among the most ancient in the world. 
The Vedas consist of thousands of hymns — prayers in the 
form of poems and songs — that were recited orally, not 
written. Those hymns were composed in the Sapta Sindhava 
region (which we visit in Chapter 5). It is difficult to say","78 Exploring Society: India and Beyond

Moving on in time, we see names for other parts of India 
appear in the literature. The Mahābhārata is one of India’s 
most famous texts (we read about it in the theme ‘Our 
Cultural Heritage and Knowledge Traditions’). Interestingly, 
it lists many regions, such as Kāshmīra (more or less today’s 
Kashmir), Kurukṣhetra (parts of Haryana today), Vanga

to India as ‘Hind’, ‘Hidu’ or ‘Hindu’, which are adaptations 
in their language of ‘Sindhu’. (Note that in ancient Persian, 
‘Hindu’ is a purely geographical term; it does not refer here 
to the Hindu religion.) 
Based on these Persian sources, the ancient Greeks named 
the region ‘Indoi’ or  ‘Indike’. They dropped the initial letter 
‘h’ of ‘Hindu’ because this letter did not exist in their Greek 
language.

the early sixteenth century, Babur used Hindustan 
to describe the geography, the fauna and the culture

later in the chapter, this was somewhat similar to the 
way the fourteenth-century poet Amir Khusrau used 
the word “Hind”. While the idea of a geographical 
and cultural entity like “India” did exist, the term 
“Hindustan” did not carry the political and national 
meanings which we associate with it today.

and south of the snowy mountains is 
called Bhārata.”

India, it is generally written as ‘Bharat’, while in south 
India, it is often ‘Bharatam’.

brief description of Bhārata is correct?

adopted a similar definition for India. For instance, a poem

5 ― India, That Is Bharat
Today, the India we know is a modern nation, with defined 
borders, defined states and a known population. However , 
it was very different 500 years ago, 2,000 years ago or even 
5,000 years ago. This region of the world, which we often call 
the ‘Indian Subcontinent’, has had many different names 
and shifting boundaries. We can learn about India’s past 
and evolution from many different sources. Let us explore.
THINK ABOUT IT 
Consider the physical map of the Indian Subcontinent at 
the start of the chapter. What are its natural boundaries 
that you can make out?
In the course of history, India has been called by many  
names — both by its inhabitants and by visitors from outside. 
These names come to us from ancient texts, accounts of 
travellers and pilgrims, and inscriptions.
Inhabitants:

Moving on in time, we see names for other parts of India 
appear in the literature. The Mahābhārata is one of India’s 
most famous texts (we read about it in the theme ‘Our 
Cultural Heritage and Knowledge Traditions’). Interestingly, 
it lists many regions, such as Kāshmīra (more or less today’s 
Kashmir), Kurukṣhetra (parts of Haryana today), Vanga 
(parts of Bengal), Prāgjyotiṣha (roughly today’s Assam), 
Kaccha (today’s Kutch), Kerala (more or less today’s Kerala),

But when do we come across a name for the entire Indian 
Subcontinent? Because ancient Indian texts are difficult to 
date, this is not an easy question to answer . The Mahābhārata

a few Bengali women like Kailashbashini Debi wrote books
highlighting the experiences of women – about how women were
imprisoned at home, kept in ignorance, forced to do hard domestic
labour and treated unjustly by the very people they served. In the
1880s, in present-day Maharashtra, Tarabai Shinde and Pandita
Ramabai wrote with passionate anger about the miserable lives
of  upper-caste Hindu women, especially widows. A woman in a
Tamil novel expressed what reading meant to women who were
so greatly confined by social regulations:  ‘For various reasons, my
world is small … Mor e than half  my life’s happiness has come
from books …’
While Urdu, Tamil, Bengali and Marathi print culture had developed
early, Hindi printing began seriously only from the 1870s. Soon, a
large segment of it was devoted to the education of women. In

Introduction
Humans, like most mammals, live on land. Land, as you may 
have noticed, has many forms and features; its appearance 
changes a lot from one region to another . Suppose that you 
are travelling by road from the region known as Chhota 
Nagpur in Jharkhand, reach Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh, 
and go on to Almora in Uttarakhand. On the way, you will 
see very different landscapes. In fact, you will encounter 
three major landforms, which we will now explore.
LET’S EXPLORE
 Æ As a class activity, form groups of four or five students 
and observe the school’s surroundings. What kind of 
landscape do you see? Will the landscape change a few 
kilometres away? Or within some 50 kilometres? Compare 
with other groups.
 Æ In the same groups, discuss a journey that any of you 
has made through a region of India. List the different 
landscapes seen on the way. Compare with other groups.","granted, as if what we see has always 
been in the world we inhabit. But most of 
us have our moments of wonder, when we are 
curious, and we ask questions that actually are historical. 
Watching someone sip a cup of tea at a roadside tea stall, 
you may wonder – when did people begin to drink tea or 
coffee? Looking out of the window of a train you may ask 
yourself – when were railways built and how did people 
travel long distances before the age of railways? Reading 
the newspaper in the morning you may be curious to know 
how people got to hear about things before newspapers 
began to be printed.

Xuanzang (formerly spelt Hiuen Tsang, Hsuan 
Tsang, etc.) travelled from China to India in the 
7th century CE. He visited many parts of India, met 
scholars, collected Buddhist texts, and returned 
to China after 17 years. There, he translated 
the manuscripts he took back with him from 
Sanskrit into Chinese. Several other Chinese

How did the term ‘Hindustān’ originate and when was it first used?,"According to the context, the term ""Hindustān"" originated in the thirteenth century and was used by a ruler to describe the areas of Punjab, Haryana, and lands between the Ganga and Yamuna rivers.

way the fourteenth-century poet Amir Khusrau used 
the word “Hind”. While the idea of a geographical 
and cultural entity like “India” did exist, the term 
“Hindustan” did not carry the political and national 
meanings which we associate with it today.

How do We Know?
What sources do historians use in writing about the last 
250 years of Indian history? 
Administration produces records
One important source is the official records of the British 
administration. The British believed that the act of writing 
was important. Every instruction, plan, policy decision, 
agreement, investigation had to be clearly written up. Once 
this was done, things could be properly studied and debated. 
This conviction produced an administrative culture of 
memos, notings and reports. 
The British also felt that all important documents 
and letters needed to be carefully preserved. So they 
set up record rooms attached to all administrative 
institutions. The village tahsildar’s office, the collectorate, 
the commissioner’s office, the provincial secretariats, 
the lawcourts – all had their record rooms. Specialised 
institutions like archives and museums were also 
established to preserve important records.","83

From Village to City
The vast plains of the Punjab (today 
divided between India and Pakistan) and 
Sindh (now in Pakistan) are watered by 
the Indus River and its tributaries. This 
made those plains fertile and, therefore, 
favourable to agriculture. A little further 
east, a few millenniums ago, another 
river , the Sarasvatī, used to flow from 
the foothills of the Himalayas through 
Haryana, Punjab, parts of Rajasthan 
and Gujarat (see Fig. 6.3). In this whole 
region, from about 3500 BCE, villages 
grew into towns, and with increasing 
trade and other exchanges, those towns 
further grew into cities. This transition 
happened around 2600 BCE. 
Archaeologists gave this civilisation 
several names — ‘Indus’, ‘Harappan’, 
‘Indus-Sarasvatī’ or ‘Sindhu-Sarasvatī’

Conclusion
Considerable social change took place in the subcontinent 
during the period we have been examining. -based 
society and tribal people constantly interacted with each 
other. This interaction caused both kinds of societies 
to adapt and change. There were many different tribes 
and they took up diverse livelihoods. Over a period of 
time, many of them merged with caste-based society. 
Others, however, rejected both the caste system and 
orthodox Hinduism. Some tribes established extensive 
states with well-organised systems of administration. 
They thus became politically powerful. This brought 
them into conflict with larger and more complex 
kingdoms and empire

civilisation, they felt, had attained its glory in the 
ancient past, but had subsequently declined. In order to 
understand India, it was necessary to discover the sacred 
and legal texts that were produced in the ancient period. 
For only those texts could reveal the real ideas and laws 
of the Hindus and Muslims, and only a new study of 
these texts could form the basis of future development  
in India.
So Jones and Colebrooke went about discovering  ancient 
texts, understanding their meaning, translating them, and 
making their findings known to others. This project, they 
believed, would not only help the British learn from Indian 
culture, but it would also help Indians rediscover their own 
heritage, and understand the lost glories of their past. In this 
process, the British would become the guardians of Indian 
culture as well as its masters.

How did names like ‘Indike’ and ‘Yindu’ develop over time?,"According to the context, names like 'Indike' and 'Yindu' developed over time as adaptations of the original name 'Sindhu' or 'Indus River'.

Similarly, the Chinese referred to India as 'Yintu' or 'Yindu', also derived from 'Sindhu'.","Here's how the names 'Indike' and 'Yindu' developed, according to the text:

*   **Indike:** The Persians, after gaining control of the Indus region (Sindhu), referred to it as 'Hind', 'Hidu', or 'Hindu'. The ancient Greeks then adopted this term, dropping the 'h' (as it didn't exist in their language) and naming the region 'Indoi' or 'Indike'.

*   **Yindu:** The ancient Chinese also derived their name for India, 'Yintu' or 'Yindu', from 'Sindhu' through the progression: Sindhu -> Hindhu -> Indu -> Yindu.
","Persian emperor launched a military campaign and gained 
control of the region of the Indus River , which, as we saw, 
was earlier called ‘Sindhu’. So, it is no surprise that in their 
earliest records and stone inscriptions, the Persians referred 
to India as ‘Hind’, ‘Hidu’ or ‘Hindu’, which are adaptations 
in their language of ‘Sindhu’. (Note that in ancient Persian, 
‘Hindu’ is a purely geographical term; it does not refer here 
to the Hindu religion.) 
Based on these Persian sources, the ancient Greeks named 
the region ‘Indoi’ or  ‘Indike’. They dropped the initial letter 
‘h’ of ‘Hindu’ because this letter did not exist in their Greek 
language.

* Indian nationalists looking into the past to discover India's great achievements, writing about ancient times when art, architecture, science, mathematics, religion, culture, law, philosophy, crafts, and trade flourished.
* The glorification of India's past by nationalist historians urging readers to take pride in its great achievements and struggle to change miserable conditions under British rule.

These foreign influences led to differing historical perceptions of India.","Foreign influences, particularly British, shaped historical perceptions of India by viewing it as having attained glory in the ancient past but subsequently declining. They believed understanding ancient texts was crucial to rediscovering India's true heritage and forming the basis for future development, with the British acting as guardians of Indian culture. This perspective led to Indians looking into the past to discover India’s great achievements to counter the British perception of Indians as backward.
","As we live our life in the present and read about the happenings around the world in
newspapers, we do not usually pause to think about the longer history of these
events. We see change before our eyes, but do not always ask, why ar
e things changing?
Very often we do not even notice that things were not the same in the past. History
is about tracking these changes, understanding how and why they are taking place,
how the present world in which we live has evolved.
The focus of the history books of Classes IX and X is on the emergence of the contemporary
world. In earlier classes (VI – VIII) you have read about the history of India. In the next
two years (Classes IX and X) you will see how the story of India’s pasts is related to the
larger history of the world. We cannot understand what was happening within India unless
we see this connection. This is particularly true about a world in which economies and","ancient cultures, both of India and the West. Indian 
civilisation, they felt, had attained its glory in the 
ancient past, but had subsequently declined. In order to 
understand India, it was necessary to discover the sacred 
and legal texts that were produced in the ancient period. 
For only those texts could reveal the real ideas and laws 
of the Hindus and Muslims, and only a new study of 
these texts could form the basis of future development  
in India.
So Jones and Colebrooke went about discovering  ancient 
texts, understanding their meaning, translating them, and 
making their findings known to others. This project, they 
believed, would not only help the British learn from Indian 
culture, but it would also help Indians rediscover their own 
heritage, and understand the lost glories of their past. In this 
process, the British would become the guardians of Indian 
culture as well as its masters. 
Influenced by such ideas, many Company officials","nation, Indian history had to be thought about differently. The British
saw Indians as backward and primitive, incapable of governing
themselves. In response, Indians began looking into the past to
discover India’s great achievements. They wrote about the glorious
developments in ancient times when art and architecture, science
and mathematics, religion and culture, law and philosophy, crafts
and trade had f lourished. This glorious time, in their vie w, was
followed by a history of decline, when India was colonised. These
nationalist histories urged the readers to take pride in India’s great
achievements in the past and str uggle to c hange the miser able
conditions of life under British rule.
These efforts to unify people were not without problems. When the
past being glorified was Hindu, when the images celebrated were
drawn from Hindu iconography, then people of other communities
felt left out.

materials (such as stone or metal) and the production 
of finished goods (such as ornaments and tools)

As communities grew, so did their social complexity. 
Leaders or ‘chieftains’ were responsible for the well-being 
of the people, and everyone collectively worked towards 
the community’s welfare. For example, there was no sense 
of individual ownership; the lands were collectively sowed 
and harvested.
As time went by, hamlets grew into sizeable villages that 
exchanged goods — mostly food, clothing and tools. Slowly, 
networks of communication and exchange were established 
among those villages, and some of them grew into small 
towns. New technologies appeared — for example pottery, 
for making pots and other clay objects; and the use of metal 
(copper first, iron later), which helped make durable tools, 
objects of daily use and ornaments.

social classes grew further.

borders, defined states and a known population. However , 
it was very different 500 years ago, 2,000 years ago or even 
5,000 years ago. This region of the world, which we often call

Some of this dramatic change, though on a smaller scale, occurred
closer home in west Punjab. Here the British Indian government
built a network of irrigation canals to transform semi-desert wastes
into fertile agricultural lands that could grow wheat and cotton for
export. The Canal Colonies, as the areas irrigated by the new canals
were called,
 were settled by peasants from other parts of Punjab.

Earth was covered with ice — this is called an ‘Ice Age’, as 
you will learn in greater detail in Science. Later , when the 
climate warmed up, this ice partly melted, and the resulting 
waters swelled the existing rivers and eventually drained 
into the oceans. The last Ice Age lasted from over 100,000 
(one lakh) years ago to around 12,000 years ago. 
Afterwards, living conditions improved for humans; in many 
parts of the world, they started settling down and cultivating 
cereals and grains. They also domesticated animals such as 
cattle, goats, etc. With more food available, these communities 
grew in size and number , and often settled down near rivers. 
This was not only because of the availability of water , but 
also because the soil would be more fertile there. It made the 
process of growing crops easier .

Why are the inhabitants of this civilisation called ‘Harappans’ 
today? That is simply because the city of Harappa (today in 
Pakistan’s Punjab) was the first of this civilisation to be exca-
vated, way back in 1920–21, over a century ago.
This development is also called the ‘First Urbanisation of 
India’.

From Village to City
The vast plains of the Punjab (today 
divided between India and Pakistan) and 
Sindh (now in Pakistan) are watered by 
the Indus River and its tributaries. This 
made those plains fertile and, therefore, 
favourable to agriculture. A little further 
east, a few millenniums ago, another 
river , the Sarasvatī, used to flow from 
the foothills of the Himalayas through 
Haryana, Punjab, parts of Rajasthan 
and Gujarat (see Fig. 6.3). In this whole 
region, from about 3500 BCE, villages 
grew into towns, and with increasing 
trade and other exchanges, those towns 
further grew into cities. This transition 
happened around 2600 BCE. 
Archaeologists gave this civilisation 
several names — ‘Indus’, ‘Harappan’, 
‘Indus-Sarasvatī’ or ‘Sindhu-Sarasvatī’ 
civilisation. We will use all these terms. 
Its inhabitants are called ‘Harappans’. 
It is one of the oldest civilisations in the 
world.

connected India to the Gulf and Red Sea Ports; Masulipatam on

Southeast Asian ports.
A variety of Indian merchants and bankers were involved in this
network of export trade – financing production, carrying goods
and supplying exporters. Supply merchants linked the port towns to
the inland regions. They gave advances to weavers, procured the
woven cloth from weaving villages, and carried the supply to the
ports. At the port, the big shippers and export merchants had brokers
who negotiated the price and bought goods from the supply
merchants operating inland.
By the 1750s this network, controlled by Indian merchants, was
breaking down.
The European companies gradually gained power – first securing a
variety of concessions from local courts, then the monopoly rights
to trade. This resulted in a decline of the old ports of Surat and","dishes would you prepare, based on the data given above?

6 ― The Beginnings of Indian Civilisation
This intense agricultural activity was managed by hun-
dreds of small rural sites or villages. Then as now, the cities 
could survive only if enough agricultural produce from 
rural areas reached them on a daily basis.
The Harappans also domesticated a number of animals for 
meat consumption and fished both in rivers and in the sea.

bones found during excavations.

Our Cultural Heritage and Knowledge Traditions
Indian culture, by any estimate, is several millenniums old. 
Like any ancient tree, it has many roots and many branches. 
The roots nurture a common trunk. And from the trunk 
emerge many branches, which are different manifestations 
of Indian culture, yet united by a common trunk.
Some of these branches are about art, literature, science, 
medicine, religion, the art of governance, martial arts, and 
so on. There are also ‘schools of thought’, by which we mean 
groups of thinkers or spiritual seekers who share similar 
ideas about human life, the world, etc.
Many archaeologists and scholars have pointed out that 
some of India’s cultural roots go all the way to the Indus

Democracy
You may have noticed that we earlier mentioned 
‘representatives of the people’. This is one of the foundation 
stones of the system of governance adopted by most countries 
of the world — democracy. The word ‘democracy’ comes 
from two Greek words — dēmos meaning ‘people’, and 
kratos meaning ‘rule’ or ‘power’; so ‘democracy’ literally 
means the ‘rule of the people’.

The roots nurture a common trunk. And from the trunk 
emerge many branches, which are different manifestations 
of Indian culture, yet united by a common trunk.
Some of these branches are about art, literature, science, 
medicine, religion, the art of governance, martial arts, and 
so on. There are also ‘schools of thought’, by which we mean 
groups of thinkers or spiritual seekers who share similar 
ideas about human life, the world, etc.

some of India’s cultural roots go all the way to the Indus

of India, and indeed among the most ancient in the world.

c. Vedic schools of thought
Vedic culture also developed many rituals (yajña, often 
read as ‘yagya’) directed towards various deities (gods or 
goddesses) for individual or collective benefit and wellbeing.
Daily rituals were generally in the form of prayers and 
offerings to Agni, the deity associated with fire, but those 
rituals became more and more complex in the course of 
time.
A group of texts known as ‘Upaniṣhads’ built upon Vedic 
concepts and introduced new ones, such as rebirth (taking 
birth again and again) and karma (our actions or their 
results). According to one school of thought, generally 
known as ‘Vedanta’, everything — human life, nature and 
the universe — is one divine essence called brahman (not 
to be confused with the god Brahmā) or sometimes just tat 
(‘that’). Two well-known mantras express this in a simple 
but profound way:

Our Cultural Heritage and Knowledge Traditions
Although the Vedic, Buddhist and Jain schools had important 
differences, they also shared some common concepts, 
such as dharma, karma, rebirth, the search for an end to 
suffering and ignorance, and many important values. This 
is the ‘trunk’ of the tree we started this chapter with.
Folk and Tribal Roots
The cultural roots we have seen so far are well documented 
in many texts.  India has also had rich ‘oral traditions’, that 
is, teachings or practices transmitted through everyday 
practice, without written texts (this is the case of the 
Vedas). Among them are numerous folk traditions, that 
is, transmitted by common people, and tribal traditions, 
transmitted by tribes. 
What is a tribe? 
There are many definitions for this social entity. Today, 
anthropologists usually consider a tribe to be a group of 
families or clans sharing a tradition of common descent, a","phase but throughout its evolution, has been influenced 
by tribal religions.”
Clearly, the result of this long interaction has been mutual 
enrichment. In this manner , folk and tribal beliefs and 
practices also count among India’s cultural roots. We will 
further develop this point in the next chapter .
Before we move on … 
 Æ The Vedas, India’s earliest texts, gave rise to several schools 
of thought. Vedanta and Yoga are among the best known.

the Vedas and laid emphasis on some specific values and 
practices.

methods, they also shared some important concepts; they 
were all looking for the cause of suffering and the means 
of removing ignorance.

In Kashmir, the Rishi order was established by Sheikh Nuruddin Wali (also known as Nund Rishi) in the 15th and 16th centuries, which had a deep impact on the life of the people in Kashmir.

Conclusion
Considerable social change took place in the subcontinent 
during the period we have been examining. -based 
society and tribal people constantly interacted with each 
other. This interaction caused both kinds of societies 
to adapt and change. There were many different tribes 
and they took up diverse livelihoods. Over a period of 
time, many of them merged with caste-based society. 
Others, however, rejected both the caste system and 
orthodox Hinduism. Some tribes established extensive 
states with well-organised systems of administration. 
They thus became politically powerful. This brought 
them into conflict with larger and more complex 
kingdoms and empire

The Upaniṣhads also introduced the concept of ātman or 
Self — the divine essence that resides in every being but  
is ultimately one with brahman. It follows that everything  
in this world is connected and interdependent. This 
explains a common prayer that begins with sarve bhavantu

wish them all to be free from disease and sorrow.

Brahmanas. 
They deliberated on the status of a group known as 
rathakaras (literally, chariot makers). They laid down 
their occupations, which were to include architecture, 
building coaches and chariots, erecting gateways 
for temples with images in them, preparing wooden 
equipment used to perform sacrifices, building 
mandapas, making jewels for the king.

visit in Chapter 6). Later on, over time, hundreds of schools 
of thought emerged in India. We will see here a few early 
schools, which have shaped India into a country with a 
unique personality. By understanding them and their roots, 
we can understand ‘India, that is Bharat’ better .
The Vedas and Vedic Culture
a. What are the Vedas? 
The word “Veda” comes from the Sanskrit vid which 
means ‘knowledge’ (hence vidyā, for instance). We briefly 
mentioned the Ṛig Veda in earlier chapters. In fact, there 
are four Vedas — the Ṛig Veda, the Yajur Veda, the Sāma 
Veda and the Atharva Veda. They are the most ancient texts 
of India, and indeed among the most ancient in the world. 
The Vedas consist of thousands of hymns — prayers in the 
form of poems and songs — that were recited orally, not 
written. Those hymns were composed in the Sapta Sindhava 
region (which we visit in Chapter 5). It is difficult to say","devoted to Shiva) and Alvars (saints devoted to Vishnu) 
who came from all castes including those considered 
“untouchable” like the Pulaiyar and the Panars. They 
were sharply critical of the Buddhists and Jainas 
and preached ardent love of Shiva or Vishnu as the 
path to salvation. They drew upon the ideals of love 
and heroism as found in the Sangam literature (the 
earliest example of Tamil literature, composed during 
the early centuries of the Common Era) and blended 
them with the values of bhakti. The Nayanars and 
Alvars went from place to place composing exquisite 
poems in praise of the deities enshrined in the villages 
they visited, and set them to music.
You can observe 
this process of 
local myths and 
legends receiving 
wider acceptance 
even today. Can 
you find some 
examples 
around you?

How did early Indians practice governance and decision-making?,"According to the given context, early Indians practiced governance and decision-making through tribal chiefs who had administrative power and controlled their territories. They also had their own police and decided on local rules of land and forest management.","Before the arrival of the British, tribal chiefs enjoyed economic power and had the right to administer and control their territories. In some places, they had their own police and decided on the local rules of land and forest management.
","British officials saw settled tribal groups like the Gonds 
and Santhals as more civilised than hunter-gatherers or 
shifting cultivators. Those who lived in the forests were 
considered to be wild and savage: they needed to be settled 
and civilised. 
How did Colonial Rule Affect Tribal Lives?
The lives of tribal groups changed during British rule. Let 
us see what these changes were.
What happened to tribal chiefs?
Before the arrival of the British, in many areas the tribal 
chiefs were important people. They enjoyed a certain 
amount of economic power and had the right to administer 
and control their territories. In some places they had 
their own police and decided on the local rules of land 
and forest management. Under British rule, the functions 
and powers of the tribal chiefs changed considerably. 
They were allowed to keep their land titles over a cluster 
of villages and rent out lands, but they lost much of their 
administrative power and were forced to follow laws made","46 OUR PASTS – III
Fig. 8 – Godara women weaving
Many tribal groups reacted against the 
colonial forest laws. They disobeyed the 
new rules, continued with practices that 
were declared illegal, and at times rose 
in open rebellion. Such was the revolt of 
Songram Sangma in 1906  in Assam, and 
the forest satyagraha of the 1930s in the 
Central Provinces.
The problem with trade
During the nineteenth century, tribal 
groups found that traders and money-
lenders were coming into the forests more 
often, wanting to buy forest produce, 
offering cash loans, and asking them to 
work for wages. It took tribal groups some 
time to understand the consequences of 
what was happening.
Let us consider the case of the silk 
growers. In the eighteenth century, Indian 
silk was in demand in European markets. 
The fine quality of Indian silk was highly 
valued and exports from India increased 
rapidly. As the market expanded, East India Company","xix

What were the key ideas of the Upanishads?,"Based on the provided context, the key ideas of the Upanishads are:

* The importance of asking questions and seeking knowledge, regardless of age or gender.
* The concept of brahman as a single divine essence that underlies all existence, including human life, nature, and the universe.
* Rebirth (taking birth again and again) and karma (the results of our actions).
* Everything is interconnected and emerges from the same essence, using analogies such as the seed of a banyan fruit or different pots made from the same clay.","The key ideas of the Upanishads, according to the provided text, include:

*   **Brahman:** The concept of Brahman as the one divine essence underlying everything in the universe, including human life and nature.
*   **Rebirth:** The idea of taking birth again and again.
*   **Karma:** The principle that our actions have consequences.
*   **The unity of all things:** The understanding that everything emerges from the same essence (Brahman), as illustrated by the analogy of the banyan seed and the clay pots.
*   **Atman is Brahman:** The realization that ""You are That"" (Tat Tvam Asi), meaning the individual self (Atman) is identical to Brahman.

Many stories from the Upaniṣhads tell us the importance of 
asking questions, whether these questions come from men, 
women or children.
Śhvetaketu and the seed of reality  
(Chhāndogya Upaniṣhad)
Rishi Uddālaka Āruṇi sent his 
son, Śhvetaketu, to a gurukula 
to learn the Vedas. When 
Śhvetaketu returned 12 years 
later , his father realised he 
had become very proud of 
his learning. So Uddālaka 
tested him with questions on 
the nature of brahman, which 
Śhvetaketu could not answer .
Uddālaka proceeded to explain how brahman, though invisible, 
is everywhere, just as the seed of a banyan fruit seems empty 
when you open it, but already contains the future banyan tree; 
or just as all kinds of different pots can be made out of the same 
clay. Similarly, everything around us has emerged from the 
same essence — brahman. He concluded his teaching with these 
words, “Everything consists of this subtle essence. ... You are 
That, Śhvetaketu.”","in a paragraph of 100–150 words.
c. Vedic schools of thought
Vedic culture also developed many rituals (yajña, often 
read as ‘yagya’) directed towards various deities (gods or 
goddesses) for individual or collective benefit and wellbeing.
Daily rituals were generally in the form of prayers and 
offerings to Agni, the deity associated with fire, but those 
rituals became more and more complex in the course of 
time.
A group of texts known as ‘Upaniṣhads’ built upon Vedic 
concepts and introduced new ones, such as rebirth (taking 
birth again and again) and karma (our actions or their 
results). According to one school of thought, generally 
known as ‘Vedanta’, everything — human life, nature and 
the universe — is one divine essence called brahman (not 
to be confused with the god Brahmā) or sometimes just tat 
(‘that’). Two well-known mantras express this in a simple 
but profound way:

THINK ABOUT IT
Have you heard or read any other story that conveyed an 
important message? What values did it teach you?
Early in the 1 st millennium BCE, several more schools of 
thought grew out of the Vedas. One of them was Yoga, which 
developed methods intended to achieve the realisation  
of brahman in one’s consciousness. Together , these schools  
of thought became the foundations for what we call","Sanskrit language. They were addressed in poetical form 
to many deities (gods or goddesses), such as Indra, Agni, 
Varuṇa, Mitra, Sarasvatī, Uṣhas, and many more. Together 
with the seers, these deities sustained ṛitam, or truth and 
order in human life and in the ‘cosmos’.
The early rishis and rishikas saw those gods and goddesses 
as one, not separate beings. As one famous hymn puts it, 
ekam sat viprā bahudhā vadanti ...
 The Existent [that is, the supreme reality] is one, 
but sages give it many names.
In this worldview, some values were especially important, 
beginning with ‘Truth’, which was often another name for 
God. The last mantras (verses) of the Ṛig Veda  also call for 
unity among people:

control of the region of the Indus River , which, as we saw, 
was earlier called ‘Sindhu’. So, it is no surprise that in their 
earliest records and stone inscriptions, the Persians referred 
to India as ‘Hind’, ‘Hidu’ or ‘Hindu’, which are adaptations 
in their language of ‘Sindhu’. (Note that in ancient Persian, 
‘Hindu’ is a purely geographical term; it does not refer here 
to the Hindu religion.) 
Based on these Persian sources, the ancient Greeks named 
the region ‘Indoi’ or  ‘Indike’. They dropped the initial letter 
‘h’ of ‘Hindu’ because this letter did not exist in their Greek 
language.

How did the concept of brahman evolve in Indian thought?,"According to the context, the concept of brahman evolved in Indian thought through various schools of thought and philosophers. The Upaniṣhads introduced the idea that everything is connected and interdependent, with brahman being the divine essence that resides in every being. This led to the development of Yoga as a method for achieving realization of brahman in one's consciousness.

Two prominent philosophers who contributed to the evolution of the concept of brahman were Adi Shankara, who advocated for Advaita (non-dualism) and considered brahman as formless and attribute-less, and Ramanuja, who believed that union with Brahman could be achieved through intense devotion to Vishnu.

The context also mentions the story of Śhvetaketu, where his father Uddālaka taught him about the nature of brahman, explaining that everything is made up of the same essence, and that ""You are That"" (tat tvam asi).","Based on the provided context, the concept of Brahman evolved as follows:

*   The Upanishads introduced Brahman as the divine essence and ultimate reality.
*   The Upanishads equate the individual self (Atman) with Brahman, suggesting oneness.
*   Yoga developed methods to realize Brahman in one's consciousness.
*   Advaita philosophy, advocated by figures like Shankara, taught that Brahman is formless, without attributes, and the only reality, with the world being an illusion.
*   Ramanuja presented a different view, emphasizing devotion to Vishnu as a path to union with the Supreme God, while maintaining a distinction even in union.

Observe the above panel (from a Jain temple in New Delhi). 
What is striking about it? What messages does it carry?
THINK ABOUT IT
In both Buddhism and Jainism, ahimsa means much more 
than refraining from physical violence against a person or 
an animal. It also means refraining from violence in thought, 
such as having ill feelings towards anyone. If we observe 
ourselves carefully, we may notice such negative thoughts and 
learn to turn them into positive ones. Sometimes such negative 
thoughts are even directed at ourselves!
In both Buddhism and Jainism, monks, and sometimes 
nuns too, began travelling across the land to spread their 
respective teachings far and wide. Some of them created 
new monasteries in faraway places, while others led ascetic 
lives in caves cut in the rock. Archaeological findings have 
revealed many traces of those monasteries, sometimes even","happy and at peace. Following this experience, Siddhārtha 
decided to give up his palace life, leaving behind his wife 
and son. Travelling on foot as an ascetic, meeting other 
ascetics and scholars, he searched for the root cause 
of suffering in human life. After meditating for many 
days under a pipal tree at Bodh Gaya (today in Bihar), he 
attained enlightenment; he realised that avidyā (ignorance) 
and attachment are the source of human suffering and 
conceived a method to remove these two causes.
Siddhārtha, then, became 
known as the ‘Buddha’, which 
means the ‘enlightened’ or 
‘awakened’ one.
The Buddha started teaching 
what he had realised, including 
the idea of ahimsa, which is 
generally translated as ‘non-
violence’, but originally means 
‘non-hurting’ or ‘non-injuring’. 
He also insisted on a sincere 
inner discipline. The following 
saying of his expresses this 
simply:

* Anekāntavāda: accepting multiple perspectives and not just one aspect
* Aparigraha: detachment from material possessions and limiting oneself to what is truly necessary

  Aparigraha means ‘non-possession’ and advises

oneself to what is truly necessary in life.

adopted Hindu deities long ago, and possess their own 
versions of the Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa — this has 
been well documented from India’s northeastern States, all 
the way to Tamil Nadu.

There has been a constant interaction 
between folk and tribal traditions, and 
the leading schools of thought such as 
those we mentioned in this chapter . 
Deities, concepts, legends and rituals 
have been freely exchanged in both 
directions. For instance, according to 
tradition, Jagannath, worshipped at Puri 
(Odisha), was originally a tribal deity; 
this is also the case with various forms of 
the mother-goddess worshipped across 
India. Some tribes, on the other hand, 
adopted Hindu deities long ago, and possess their own 
versions of the Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa — this has 
been well documented from India’s northeastern States, all 
the way to Tamil Nadu.
How have such interactions taken place for so 
long and so naturally? It is, in the end, because 
folk, tribal and Hindu belief systems have 
many similar concepts. For instance, in all

date, the local tribal people make 
the wooden image of the deity, which 
suggests that the deity was originally 
with Vishnu.
In the twelfth century, one of the 
most important rulers of the Ganga 
dynasty, Anantavarman, decided 
to erect a temple for Purushottama 
Jagannatha at Puri. Subsequently, in 
1230, king Anangabhima III dedicated 
his kingdom to the deity and proclaimed 
himself as the “deputy” of the god.

the Moon who later rose to the higher status of a supreme god. 
This is also the case of the god Khandoba in parts of central 
India. In eastern India, the Munda and Santhal tribals, among 
others, worship Singbonga, a supreme deity who created this 
whole world. There are many more such examples.
The Indian sociologist André Béteille summed up this 
situation in these words:
“The thousands of castes and tribes on the Indian 
subcontinent have influenced each other in their 
religious beliefs and practices since the beginning of 
history and before. That the tribal religions have been 
influenced by Hinduism is widely accepted, but it is 
equally true that Hinduism, not only in its formative 
phase but throughout its evolution, has been influenced 
by tribal religions.”
Clearly, the result of this long interaction has been mutual 
enrichment. In this manner , folk and tribal beliefs and"
Why do many tribal traditions consider nature sacred?,"According to the context, many tribal traditions consider nature sacred because they regard elements of nature such as mountains, rivers, trees, plants, and animals, and some stones too, as having consciousness behind them.","According to tribal traditions, nature is considered sacred because elements of nature, such as mountains, rivers, trees, plants, and animals, are believed to have consciousness behind them.
","folk, tribal and Hindu belief systems have 
many similar concepts. For instance, in all 
three, elements of nature such as mountains, 
rivers, trees, plants and animals, and some 
stones too, are regarded as sacred, because 
there is consciousness behind all of them. 
Indeed, tribes generally worship many deities 
associated with those natural elements. For the 
Toda tribals of the Nilgiris of Tamil Nadu, for 
instance (one of them is pictured in the image on the right), 
over thirty peaks of this mountain range are residences of 
a god or a goddess; those peaks are so sacred that the Todas 
avoid pointing to them with a finger . 
But despite this multiplicity of deities, as with Hinduism, 
many tribal groups have a concept of a higher divinity or 
supreme being. For example, several tribes of Arunachal 
Pradesh worship Donyipolo, a combined form of the Sun and

 Æ Tribal belief systems and art have interacted for 
millenniums with Hinduism. There was free borrowing 
and giving from every side. Tribal belief systems generally 
regard the land and its features as sacred; they often have, 
at the same time, a higher concept of divinity.

Why is it common to see different languages and scripts across India?,"According to the context, it is common to see different languages and scripts across India because of the country's rich diversity. The Anthropological Survey of India's ""People of India project"" found that there are 325 languages using 25 scripts across the country. This diversity is a result of the country's large population (1.4 billion inhabitants, about 18 percent of the world's population) and the existence of many different communities with their own customs and traditions.","According to the provided context, it is common to see different languages and scripts across India because of India's rich diversity and large population.

A Rich Diversity
If you travel through India by train, you will notice not 
only changing landscapes but also many different types of  
dresses and food; you will hear different languages, familiar 
and unfamiliar , and see different scripts on the way. Even 
within your own region, you will often come across people 
from other parts of India with different customs and 
traditions. This is India’s rich diversity, and it is usually the 
first thing that strikes visitors to our country.
With over 1.4 billion inhabitants (about 18 percent of the 
world’s population), such diversity is not surprising! In the 
late 20th century, the Anthropological Survey of India, a 
national organisation, conducted a massive survey called 
‘People of India project’ of 4,635 communities across all 
States of the country. It counted 325 languages using 25 
scripts; it also observed that many Indians may be called","as distinct from what 
is seen as the standard 
language. In colonial 
countries like India, the 
British used the term 
to mark the difference 
between the local 
languages of everyday 
use and English – the 
language of the imperial 
masters.

An Epic Spread
Literature offers us another fine illustration of unity in 
diversity. Indian literatures are extremely diverse (and 
among the most abundant in the world). Over centuries, 
despite differences in language, technique, etc., they have 
shared important themes and concerns. Who has not 
heard of the Pañchatantra, for example? This collection 
of delightful stories, with animals as the main characters, 
teaches us important life skills. The original Sanskrit text is 
at least 2,200 years old, but its stories have been adapted in 
almost every Indian language. In fact, they have travelled 
well beyond India, all the way to Southeast Asia, the Arab 
world and Europe, inspiring new collections of stories on 
the way — it is estimated that about 200 adaptations of"
What does the British historian Vincent Smith say about India’s diversity?,"According to Vincent Smith, a British historian, India's diversity is bewildering. He wonders how a history of India can be written in the face of such diversity.

6 ― The Beginnings of Indian Civilisation
This intense agricultural activity was managed by hun-
dreds of small rural sites or villages. Then as now, the cities 
could survive only if enough agricultural produce from 
rural areas reached them on a daily basis.
The Harappans also domesticated a number of animals for 
meat consumption and fished both in rivers and in the sea. 
This is known from the large numbers of animal and fish 
bones found during excavations. 
What did Harappan cooking pots contain? Scientific 
examinations of clay pots have provided some answers,

such as remains of turmeric, ginger and banana. Clearly,

The fine quality of Indian silk was highly

officials tried to encourage silk production to meet the 
growing demand. 
Hazaribagh, in present-day Jharkhand, was an area 
where the Santhals reared cocoons. The

How do weaving techniques vary across different regions?,"Based on the provided context, weaving techniques vary across different regions in India. The document mentions specific regions such as Travancore, Madras, Mysore, Cochin, and Bengal where weavers used looms with fly shuttles, which increased productivity per worker, speeded up production, and reduced labor demand.","Weaving techniques in India vary by region. In Travancore, Madras, Mysore, Cochin, and Bengal, weavers used fly shuttle looms, boosting productivity, speeding up production, and reducing labor demand. It primarily discusses the relationship between weavers and the British East India Company, technological advancements in weaving, and the impact of these factors on weavers' lives.
","the gomastha to supervise weavers, collect supplies, and examine
the quality of cloth.
Second: it prevented Company weavers from dealing with other
buyers. One way of doing this was through the system of advances.
Once an order was placed, the weavers were given loans to purchase
the raw material for their production. Those who took loans had to
hand over the cloth they produced to the gomastha. They could not
take it to any other trader.
As loans flowed in and the demand for fine textiles expanded,
weavers eagerly took the advances, hoping to earn more. Many
weavers had small plots of land which they had earlier cultivated
along with weaving, and the produce from this took care of their
family needs. Now they had to lease out the land and devote all their
time to weaving. Weaving, in fact, required the labour of the entire
family, with children and women all engaged in different stages of
the process.
Soon, however, in many weaving villages there were reports of","This increase was linked to
a number of changes within the process of production. Let us look
briefly at some of these.
A series of inventions in the eighteenth century increased the efficacy
of each step of the production process ( carding, twisting and
spinning, and rolling). They enhanced the output per worker, enabling
each worker to produce more, and they made possible the
production of stronger threads and yarn. Then Richard Arkwright
created the cotton mill. Till this time, as you have seen, cloth
production was spread all over the countryside and carried out within
village households. But now, the costly new machines could be
purchased, set up and maintained in the mill. Within the mill all the

according to its fibre
Fuller – A person who ‘fulls’ – that is, gathers

Carding – The process in which fibres, such as
cotton or wool, are prepared prior to spinning","and 1940.
How did this happen?
This was partly because of technological changes. Handicrafts people
adopt new tec hnology if  that helps them impr ove production
without excessively pushing up costs. So, by the second decade of
the twentieth century we find weavers using looms with a fly shuttle.
This increased productivity per worker, speeded up production and
reduced labour demand. By 1941, over 35 per cent of handlooms
in India were fitted with fly shuttles: in regions like Travancore,
Madras, Mysore, Cochin, Bengal the proportion was 70 to 80 per
cent. There were several other small innovations that helped weavers
improve their productivity and compete with the mill sector.

Why was Indian cotton highly valued in European markets?,"Indian cotton was highly valued in European markets because it was fine and of good quality. Historically, fine cottons produced in India were exported to Europe.","Indian cotton was highly valued in Europe for its fine quality and was historically exported to European markets.
","over 31 per cent of the value of Indian imports; and by the 1870s
this figure  was over 50 per cent.
Cotton weavers in India thus faced two problems at the same time:
their export market collapsed, and the local market shrank, being
glutted with Manchester imports. Produced by machines at lower
costs, the imported cotton goods were so cheap that weavers could
not easily compete with them. By the 1850s, reports from most
weaving regions of India narrated stories of decline and desolation.
By the 1860s, weavers faced a new problem. They could not get
sufficient supply of raw cotton of good quality. When the American
The Commissioner of Patna wrote:
‘It appears that twenty yeas ago, a brisk trade
was carried on in the manufacture of cloth at
Jahanabad, and Behar, which has in the f ormer
place entirely ceased, while in the latter the
amount of manufacture is very limited, in
consequence of the cheap and durable goods
from Manchester with which the Native","piece-goods accounted for 33 per cent of India’s exports; by
1850-51 it was no more than 3 per cent.
Why did this happen? What were its implications?
As cotton industries developed in England, industrial groups began
worrying about imports from other countries. They pressurised
the government to impose import duties on cotton textiles so that
Manchester goods could sell in Britain without facing any
competition from outside. At the same time industrialists persuaded
the East India Company  to sell British manufactures in Indian
markets as well. Exports of British cotton goods increased
dramatically in the early nineteenth century.  At the end of the
eighteenth century there had been virtually no import of cotton
piece-goods into India.  But by 1850 cotton piece-goods constituted
over 31 per cent of the value of Indian imports; and by the 1870s
this figure  was over 50 per cent.
Cotton weavers in India thus faced two problems at the same time:","local and imported curios to tourists whose numbers were

2.6 Indian Trade, Colonialism and the Global System
Historically, fine cottons produced in India were exported  to
Europe. With industrialisation, British cotton manufacture
began to expand, and industrialists pressurised the government
to restrict cotton imports and protect local industries. Tariffs
were imposed on cloth imports into Britain. Consequently, the
inflow of fine Indian cotton began to decline.
From the early nineteenth century, British manufacturers also began
to seek overseas markets for their cloth. Excluded from the British

How do Indian festivals illustrate unity in diversity?,"According to the context, Indian festivals illustrate unity in diversity by showcasing cultural interactions and enrichments across various regions and tribes.

this question, we will explore a few dimensions of Indian life.

The anthropologist K.S. Singh directed 
the ‘People of India’ project we referred 
to earlier (see page 126). In the case of 
the Mahābhārata, he observed, “There 
is hardly a place in the country which 
the epic heroes such as the Pandavas, did not visit according 
to folklores.” And the same may be said of the Rāmāyaṇa. 
Over the centuries, perhaps more than any other texts, 
these two epics created a dense web of cultural interactions 
across India and many parts of Asia. Another example of 
unity in diversity.

borders, defined states and a known population. However , 
it was very different 500 years ago, 2,000 years ago or even 
5,000 years ago. This region of the world, which we often call 
the ‘Indian Subcontinent’, has had many different names 
and shifting boundaries. We can learn about India’s past 
and evolution from many different sources. Let us explore.

So we see that the life of these pastoral groups was sustained by a
careful consideration of a host of factors. They had to judge how
long the herds could stay in one area, and know where they could
find water and pasture. They needed to calculate the timing of their
movements, and ensure that they could move through different
territories. They had to set up a relationship with farmers on the
way, so that the herds could graze in harvested fields and manure the
soil. They combined a range of different activities – cultivation, trade,
and herding – to make their living.
How did the life of pastoralists change under colonial rule?

7 ― India’s Cultural Roots
There has been a constant interaction 
between folk and tribal traditions, and 
the leading schools of thought such as 
those we mentioned in this chapter . 
Deities, concepts, legends and rituals 
have been freely exchanged in both 
directions. For instance, according to 
tradition, Jagannath, worshipped at Puri 
(Odisha), was originally a tribal deity; 
this is also the case with various forms of 
the mother-goddess worshipped across 
India. Some tribes, on the other hand, 
adopted Hindu deities long ago, and possess their own 
versions of the Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa — this has 
been well documented from India’s northeastern States, all 
the way to Tamil Nadu.
How have such interactions taken place for so 
long and so naturally? It is, in the end, because 
folk, tribal and Hindu belief systems have 
many similar concepts. For instance, in all

What sources do historians use in writing about the last

Administration produces records
One important source is the official records of the British 
administration. The British believed that the act of writing 
was important. Every instruction, plan, policy decision, 
agreement, investigation had to be clearly written up. Once 
this was done, things could be properly studied and debated. 
This conviction produced an administrative culture of 
memos, notings and reports. 
The British also felt that all important documents 
and letters needed to be carefully preserved. So they 
set up record rooms attached to all administrative 
institutions. The village tahsildar’s office, the collectorate, 
the commissioner’s office, the provincial secretariats, 
the lawcourts – all had their record rooms. Specialised 
institutions like archives and museums were also 
established to preserve important records.","INTRODUCTION: HOW, WHEN AND WHERE         7

travellers, autobiographies of important personalities, and

were debated in public. Leaders and reformers wrote to

How do traditional Indian textiles reflect diversity?,"According to the context, traditional Indian textiles reflect diversity through various ways of weaving, designing, and coloring. The example of the sari shows unity in terms of the type of cloth, while diversity is reflected in the many variations of designs, colors, and fabrics used. Additionally, different regions and communities have developed their own styles of clothing, further emphasizing the diversity aspect.","Traditional Indian textiles, specifically the sari, reflect diversity through variations in fabrics (cotton, silk, synthetic), weaving methods, designs (integral to the cloth or printed), and endless color variations produced from diverse pigments.

designs are part of the cloth, 
while others are printed after 
the cloth is woven. Finally, 
there are endless variations 
in the colours, which are 
produced from many kinds  
of pigments.

the sari reflects both unity and

For a very long time, India produced the finest cotton in the 
world and Indian textiles were exported as far away as Europe. 
One beautiful type of printed cotton called ‘chintz’ became so 
popular in 17th-century Europe that the sale of some European 
dresses dropped sharply. Eventually, to protect their own 
products, England and France decided to ban the import of 
chintz from India!","India has developed its own styles of 
clothing and dresses. Yet, we notice 
a commonality in some traditional 
Indian dresses, irrespective of the 
material used. An obvious example 
is the plain length of cloth called 
the sari, a type of clothing worn in 
most parts of India and made from 
different fabrics — mostly cotton or 
silk, but nowadays synthetic fabrics 
too. Banarasi, Kanjivaram, Paithani, 
Patan Patola, Muga or Mysore are some 
of the famous types of silk saris. There 
are many more kinds of cotton saris. 
Altogether , this unstitched piece of cloth 
comes in hundreds of varieties. They are

Why did European countries ban Indian cotton imports in the 17th century?,"According to the context, European countries banned Indian cotton imports in the 17th century because British industrialists pressured the government to restrict cotton imports and protect local industries. This was done by imposing tariffs on cloth imports into Britain, which led to a decline in the inflow of fine Indian cotton.","The provided context does not directly state that European countries banned Indian cotton imports in the 17th century. However, it does say that with industrialisation, British cotton manufacture began to expand, and industrialists pressured the government to restrict cotton imports and protect local industries, which led to tariffs being imposed on cloth imports into Britain.

2.6 Indian Trade, Colonialism and the Global System
Historically, fine cottons produced in India were exported  to
Europe. With industrialisation, British cotton manufacture
began to expand, and industrialists pressurised the government
to restrict cotton imports and protect local industries. Tariffs
were imposed on cloth imports into Britain. Consequently, the
inflow of fine Indian cotton began to decline.
From the early nineteenth century, British manufacturers also began
to seek overseas markets for their cloth. Excluded from the British

1850-51 it was no more than 3 per cent.
Why did this happen? What were its implications?
As cotton industries developed in England, industrial groups began
worrying about imports from other countries. They pressurised
the government to impose import duties on cotton textiles so that
Manchester goods could sell in Britain without facing any
competition from outside. At the same time industrialists persuaded
the East India Company  to sell British manufactures in Indian
markets as well. Exports of British cotton goods increased
dramatically in the early nineteenth century.  At the end of the
eighteenth century there had been virtually no import of cotton
piece-goods into India.  But by 1850 cotton piece-goods constituted
over 31 per cent of the value of Indian imports; and by the 1870s
this figure  was over 50 per cent.
Cotton weavers in India thus faced two problems at the same time:","over 31 per cent of the value of Indian imports; and by the 1870s
this figure  was over 50 per cent.
Cotton weavers in India thus faced two problems at the same time:
their export market collapsed, and the local market shrank, being
glutted with Manchester imports. Produced by machines at lower
costs, the imported cotton goods were so cheap that weavers could
not easily compete with them. By the 1850s, reports from most
weaving regions of India narrated stories of decline and desolation.
By the 1860s, weavers faced a new problem. They could not get
sufficient supply of raw cotton of good quality. When the American

means that he or she speaks Tamil or Oriya and lives 
in Tamil Nadu or Orissa. We also tend to associate 
each region with distinctive kinds of food, clothes, 
poetry, dance, music and painting. Sometimes we take 
these identities for granted and assume that they have 
existed from time immemorial. However, the frontiers 
separating regions have evolved over time (and in 
fact are still changing). Also, what we understand 
as regional cultures today are often the product of 
complex processes of intermixing of local traditions 
with ideas from other parts of the subcontinent. As 
regions, others seem to be similar across regions, and"
What are some ways in which Indian communities maintain cultural ties?,"According to the context, Indian communities maintain cultural ties by:

* Agreed-upon practices on the use of shared natural wealth and resources such as water, grazing lands, and forest produce.

Although the Vedic, Buddhist and Jain schools had important 
differences, they also shared some common concepts, 
such as dharma, karma, rebirth, the search for an end to 
suffering and ignorance, and many important values. This 
is the ‘trunk’ of the tree we started this chapter with.
Folk and Tribal Roots
The cultural roots we have seen so far are well documented 
in many texts.  India has also had rich ‘oral traditions’, that 
is, teachings or practices transmitted through everyday 
practice, without written texts (this is the case of the 
Vedas). Among them are numerous folk traditions, that 
is, transmitted by common people, and tribal traditions, 
transmitted by tribes.

There are many definitions for this social entity. Today, 
anthropologists usually consider a tribe to be a group of

How print culture assisted the growth of nationalism in inida?,"According to the provided context, print culture assisted the growth of nationalism in India by creating a new reading public. Printing reduced the cost of books, making them more accessible to an ever-growing readership. This led to a culture of reading among common people, who previously lived in an oral culture. As a result, knowledge and information became more widely available, contributing to the growth of nationalism in India.
In particular, the spread of print culture helped to disseminate nationalist ideas and literature, such as writings by Indian reformers and intellectuals, which were not possible earlier when knowledge was mainly transmitted orally. The availability of printed materials enabled people to access and share information, ideas, and perspectives that fueled the nationalist movement in India.
",Print culture assisted the growth of nationalism in India by providing easy access to nationalist ideals and ideas of freedom and equality to the masses. Social reformers could now print their opinions in newspapers which sparked off public debates. The power of reason made the common people question the authority of colonial power. Interestingly when the British tried to censor and control print media nationalist newspapers grew in number everywhere in the country. They reported on colonial misrule and encouraged people to participate in nationalist activities. Attempts to censor anti-colonial publications aroused militant protests as well.,"105 Print Culture It is difficult for us to imagine a world without printed matter. We find evidence of print everywhere around us – in books, journals, newspapers, prints of famous paintings, and also in everyday things like theatre programmes, official circulars, calendars, diaries, advertisements, cinema posters at street corners . We read printed literature, see printed images, follow the news through newspapers, and track public debates that appear in print. We take for granted this world of print and often forget that there was a time before print. We may not realise that print itself has a history which has, in fact, shaped our contemporary world. What is this history? When did printed literature begin to circulate? How has it helped create the modern world?

Printing reduced the cost of books. The time and labour required to produce each book came down, and multiple copies could be produced with greater ease. Books flooded the market, reaching out to an ever-gr owing readership. Access to books created a new culture of reading. Earlier, reading was restricted to the elites.
