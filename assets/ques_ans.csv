The context does not provide information on specific methods of measuring time in history."
What is the importance of understanding the past?,"According to the context, understanding the past is important because it is the key to understanding the present. As E.H. Carr states, ""History is an unending dialogue between the present and the past... We can fully understand the present only in the light of the past."""
What is the role of a timeline in history?,"According to the context, a timeline plays several roles in history:

1. It helps mark events and shows their sequence over a particular period.
2. It enables understanding of the order in which historical events take place.

* BCE: Years before Jesus' birth (e.g., 560 BCE)"
"Why is there no ""Year Zero"" in the Gregorian calendar?","According to the context, there is no ""Year Zero"" in the Gregorian calendar because the year 1 CE follows immediately after the year 1 BCE. This means that only 3 years have passed between dates such as 2 BCE and 2 CE, which would typically require adding 4 years if a Year Zero existed."
How do we calculate the time between BCE and CE dates?,"According to the context, to calculate the number of years between a BCE date and a CE date, you should add them and subtract 1. This is because there is no ""year zero"" in the Gregorian calendar, so only three years have passed between two dates like 2 BCE and 2 CE."
"What is a century, and how is it calculated?","According to the context, a century is any period of 100 years. Specifically in history, centuries are counted every 100 years starting from the year 1 CE. For instance, we are currently in the 21st century CE, which runs from 2001 to 2100."

This process started around the end of the last ice age and marked the beginning of agriculture, copper metallurgy, and pottery technology."
Why did early human societies settle near rivers?,"According to the context, early human societies settled near rivers because of the availability of water and fertile soil. The climate had warmed up after an Ice Age, leading to the melting of ice and swelling of existing rivers, making them a suitable place for settlements."

"
How was social equality reflected in Harappan housing?,"According to the context, social equality in Harappan housing is reflected in that the decline of cities did not lead to a class-based system. The Harappans scattered over hundreds or thousands of small rural settlements, indicating a relatively equal distribution of people without the emergence of a strong class hierarchy.

What were the possible reasons for the decline of the Harappan cities?,"According to the context, two factors are currently agreed upon as possible reasons for the decline of the Harappan cities:

1. A climatic change that affected much of the world from 2200 BCE onward, causing reduced rainfall and a drier phase, making agriculture more difficult and reducing food supply to the cities.
2. The Sarasvatī River drying up in its central basin, leading to the abandonment of cities such as Kalibangan or Banawali.

These factors are mentioned as being agreed upon by archaeologists, suggesting that they are widely accepted explanations for the decline of the Harappan civilization."
How did climate change impact the Harappan civilisation?,"According to the context, climate change was one of the factors that caused the decline and eventual abandonment of the Harappan cities. The text states: ""Two factors are currently agreed upon. First, a climatic change which affected much of the world from 2200 BCE onward, causing reduced rainfall and a drier phase.""
